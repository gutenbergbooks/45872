<p>She stood behind the counter in H. O'Neill's splendid
dry-goods emporium on Sixth avenue&mdash;only one of his
army of salesgirls, yet not a belle of the famous society
Four Hundred could eclipse her in beauty&mdash;pretty Geraldine,
with her great, starry, brown eyes lighting up a bewitching
face, with a skin like a rose-leaf, and a low, white
brow, crowned by an aureole of curly hair, in whose waves
the sunshine was tangled so that it could not get free. Her
round, white throat rose proudly from a simple, nun-like
gown of fine black serge, unadorned save by the beauty of
the form it fitted with easy grace.</p>

<p>She would have graced a queen's drawing-room, this
lovely girl with her starry eyes and demure dimples, but
untoward fate had placed her behind a glove counter in
New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>It was very cold up to ten o'clock that bright October
morning, and the great throngs of fall shoppers were not
yet out in force, so Geraldine had an idle moment in
which to gossip with her chum, plump, gray-eyed Cissy
Carroll.</p>

<p>They both belonged to an amateur dramatic society, and
a generous manager had sent them tickets for the play
that evening. It was of this anticipated pleasure that they
were chatting joyously, when a low, deep, masculine voice
spoke to Geraldine across the counter:</p>

<p>"Gloves, please."</p>

<p>She turned quickly toward her customer, and at the
same moment a very exacting lady claimed Cissy's attention.</p>

<p>The shop was rapidly filling with elegantly dressed women
of fashion, and they would have no more leisure that
day.</p>

<p>Geraldine saw before her an elegant-looking gentleman&mdash;tall,
broad-shouldered, graceful, with a clean-shaven
face, clear-cut features, fair, clustering locks, and large,
glittering, light-blue eyes, keen and clear as points of steel
in their direct gaze, but with something unpleasant somehow
in their admiring expression that made the pretty
salesgirl drop her eyes bashfully, as he continued, easily:</p>

<p>"I have lost a bet of a box of gloves to a lady, and would
like you to assist me in selecting some pretty ones to pay
the debt."</p>

<p>"What size?" she asked, as she began pulling down the
boxes.</p>

<p>"Sixes," he replied, and added: "She is a gay and pretty
young girl&mdash;an actress."</p>

<p>"An actress!" Geraldine sighed, enviously, then smothered
the sigh by saying, carelessly: "We both wear the
same size of glove."</p>

<p>"Ah!" and the customer gazed admiringly at the slender,
dimpled white hands sorting out the gloves, then continued:
"And I am an actor, and it pleases me to tell you
that I am Clifford Standish, the leading man in 'Hearts and
Homes,' the society play you are going to see to-night."</p>

<p>He laid his elegantly engraved card before her, and she
started with surprise and pleasure, faltering, eagerly:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am proud to know you&mdash;but how did you guess I
was going to the theatre to-night?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for listening, but I heard you and
your chum talking about it while I stood at the counter
waiting for you to notice me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, did I keep you waiting? I am very sorry; and if the
floor-walker had observed my inattention, I should have
been scolded."</p>

<p>Clifford Standish drank in with keen delight the music
of her voice, and thrilled with rapture at her rare beauty,
so he answered, gallantly:</p>

<p>"He did not see you, and I was in no hurry, for it pleased
me just to stand there and watch you. I was watching
your spirited face and gestures and thinking that you
would make a clever actress. You belong to an amateur
dramatic society, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, and I enjoy it so much. It is the dream of my
life to be an actress!" exclaimed Geraldine, impulsively,
her eager, brown eyes shining like stars. Her beauty
thrilled his blood like a draught of rare old wine, and he
felt that here was the love of his life, for no woman had
ever touched his heart as maddeningly as this one; so he
answered, almost as passionately, in a swift, overmastering
impulse to draw her within the circle of his life:</p>

<p>"A dream that may easily become a reality. Will you let
me help you to become an actress? I am almost sure that
I can secure you a position in my company."</p>

<p>"Oh, I would be so grateful," smiled Geraldine, her
cheeks glowing crimson with joy.</p>

<p>"Then you will permit me to call on you and talk it over?
Let me see&mdash;you will be at home this evening at seven
o'clock, will you not? May I come for half an hour at that
time?"</p>

<p>"If you please," she answered, eagerly, scribbling her
address on the back of his card.</p>

<p>He took it with thanks, his keen, blue eyes gleaming
with triumph at the success of his ruse, and then gave his
attention to the gloves, which he paid for and directed to
be sent to his hotel.</p>

<p>He lingered as long as he dared after the purchase, but
another customer soon claimed Geraldine's attention, so
he smiled and bowed himself away, leaving the young girl
with a fluttering heart and blushing cheeks, the result of
this chance, but fateful, meeting.</p>

<p>Geraldine and Cecilia were close friends, having come
together from their country homes to seek employment
among strangers in the great city. They roomed together
in the third story of a cheap apartment-house, and Cissy,
as her intimates called her, was like an older sister to the
ambitious Geraldine.</p>

<p>Cissy was twenty-five, and her friend only eighteen, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
she always assumed the role of adviser to her junior, and
as they walked home from the store that evening, she said,
reprovingly:</p>

<p>"My dear, I didn't like the young man who talked to you
so glibly over the gloves this morning."</p>

<p>"Ah, Cissy, you don't know who that young man was, or
you would be proud of his notice!" And Geraldine poured
out a breathless account of her good fortune.</p>

<p>But, to her surprise, Cecilia answered, gravely:</p>

<p>"Oh, I heard a good deal that he was saying to you, and
noticed, too, that he looked at you as if he would like to eat
you up. But, dear Geraldine, please don't let him persuade
you with his silly flatteries to go on the stage. It's a hard
life for a young girl, they say, and full of terrible temptations.
Believe me, you are better off behind O'Neill's glove
counter."</p>

<p>Geraldine's pride was cruelly wounded at Cissy's lack of
sympathy in her pet ambition, and she answered, rashly:</p>

<p>"Cissy Carroll, you're just jealous, that's why you preach
to me! I can't help being pretty and attractive, can I? And
I know that if he had offered to make you an actress, instead
of me, you'd have sung quite another tune."</p>

<p>Cecilia felt her friend's slur on her own attractiveness,
and flushed with quick resentment.</p>

<p>She knew that she was not as beautiful as Geraldine, but
she had the soft, plump prettiness of a gray dove, so attractive
to many men, and she had not lacked for admirers,
although, for reasons of her own, she was single
still, so she tossed her pretty dark head, her gray eyes
flashing scorn, and made no reply to the ungenerous attack.</p>

<p>Geraldine, still angry, continued, patronizingly:</p>

<p>"If you would like to be an actress, too, Cissy, I'll introduce
the actor to you when he calls this evening, and ask
him to get you a position."</p>

<p>"Pray, don't trouble yourself, for I sha'n't enter the room
while he's there. I despise real stage people! They're most
always shabby sheep, and their acquaintance no credit,"
returned Cissy, rudely, giving such mortal offense by the
taunt that Geraldine did not speak another word to her on
the way home.</p>

<p>They had two small rooms, and Cissy hastened to one
to prepare their simple tea, so as to get ready for the theatre,
but Geraldine hurried to beautify herself for her
caller, putting on her best gown, a garnet cashmere, with
velvet trimmings, and drawing her wealth of golden
brown locks into the classic Psyche knot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Supper's ready!" called Cissy, curtly, from the next
room.</p>

<p>"I don't want any, thank you," Geraldine answered,
coldly, and, indeed, her excitement ran too high for her to
eat.</p>

<p>So Cissy ate her solitary meal in snubbed silence, while
the radiant Geraldine entertained her caller, for Clifford
Standish soon came, and spent a delightful half-hour, having
to tear himself away at the last minute to return to his
stage duties. Then she and Cissy patched up a kind of
truce, and went together to the play, returning at the
close, Cissy silent and disapproving, and Geraldine more
determined than ever to go on the stage.</p>

<p>The girls were very distant to each other after that, but
Geraldine carried a high head, and clung to her purpose,
encouraged by the handsome young actor, who called on
her for a short while every evening, and gave her tickets
to every performance, declaring that she inspired him to
his best work by the rapt gaze of her appreciative eyes as
she sat in the audience.</p>

<p>But Cissy would not accompany her friend again to the
play, doing all she could in a quiet way to wean her from
her infatuation, but in vain.</p>

<p>She thought that Geraldine was weak and vain and
silly, and the latter believed that Cissy was jealous of her
good fortune. She hoped that she would soon be able to go
on the stage, and part from the girl who had grown so selfish
and cruel. The breach widened between their once
loving hearts, and neither tried to bridge it over by a
kind, forgiving word.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the week, Geraldine said, coldly:</p>

<p>"I am not going to work to-morrow morning, Cissy. I
asked for a day's holiday before I left the store yesterday."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Cissy, curiously.</p>

<p>"Mr. Standish has invited me to go with him on an excursion
to Newburgh to witness the firemen's parade
there. The firemen are having a grand celebration, you
know, with splendid music, a grand parade, and all sorts
of firemen's games. I wish you were going, too, Cissy!"
wistfully.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't, and I think you are imprudent to go
alone with that strange actor&mdash;so there!"</p>

<p>"Well, come with us, Cissy, won't you? I don't think he
would mind your going!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he would! 'Two are company, three a
crowd!'" Cissy quoted, flippantly, and she went alone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
work the next morning, Geraldine having started at an
earlier hour to take the day boat for Newburgh.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"I had a dream of Love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed that on a sudden, in my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A live and passionate thing leaped into being,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And conquered me. 'Twas fierce and terrible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet more lovely than the dawn, and soft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a deep power. It roused a longing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do I know not what&mdash;to give&mdash;ah, yes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than myself! And&mdash;failing that&mdash;to <i>die</i>!"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>"How lovely she is, this brown-eyed little beauty! My
heart is really touched at last, and I would give the world
to call her mine!" thought Clifford Standish, as he led
Geraldine on the crowded boat and watched her sweet face
glow with pleasure at the animated scene.</p>

<p>He said to her, in apparent jest, but secret earnest:</p>

<p>"There are some members of the crack company of the
New York Fire Department on board this morning, going
to Newburgh, to take part in the parade and games to-day.
They are fine-looking fellows, in their bright, new
uniforms, but I hope you won't lose your heart to any of
them. I think fate has destined you for an actor's bride."</p>

<p>His ardent, meaning glance made the blood flow in a torrent
to her cheeks, but she was saved the necessity of replying,
for at that moment she saw a woman's handkerchief
waved to him from the shore, and he exclaimed, in
an embarrassed tone:</p>

<p>"I see a friend beckoning me. Will you excuse me for a
moment?"</p>

<p>He ran hastily down the gang-plank, leaving Geraldine
alone on the crowded deck among the good-natured throng
of people in the nipping air of the early morning, for the
sunshine had not yet pierced the fog that lightly overhung
the beautiful Hudson.</p>

<p>But Geraldine did not mind the frosty air, for her dark-blue
suit was both warm and becoming, and the merry
crowd and the martial music played by the band inspired
her to cheerful thoughts.</p>

<p>She passed the minutes so pleasantly in watching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
animated faces about her that she did not realize how long
Mr. Standish was absent, until suddenly the whistle blew,
the gang-plank was drawn up, and the steamer moved
away from shore, thrilling the girl with swift alarm over
her escort's absence.</p>

<p>She looked about her with a keen, searching gaze, then
back to the shore.</p>

<p>A crowd of people were leaving the wharf, but among
none of them could she distinguish the stately form of Mr.
Standish.</p>

<p>"What had become of her escort?" she asked herself, in
terror, wondering if he had willfully deserted her like
this.</p>

<p>A choking sob rose up in her pretty throat, and her
eyes filled with frightened tears.</p>

<p>She thought, miserably:</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish I hadn't come! I wish I had listened to
Cissy's warnings! Why did Mr. Standish treat me like
this? He is a mean wretch, and I'll never, never speak to
him again!"</p>

<p>Poor little Geraldine, so lovely and so impulsive, if she
had kept to that resolution, this story would never have
been written. Her life would have flowed on too quietly
and happily to have tempted a novelist's pen.</p>

<p>But "fate is above us all."</p>

<p>She looked about her despairingly for a friendly face
among all those strangers.</p>

<p>Her tearful eyes encountered the gaze of a fireman who
had been covertly watching her ever since she came on
board.</p>

<p>He was a magnificent specimen of athletic young manhood,
his fine straight figure setting off to advantage his
resplendent uniform of dark-blue, with fawn-colored facings
and gilt buttons. His face was bold, handsome, and
winning, with a straight nose, laughing dark-blue eyes, a
dark, curling mustache, while beneath his blue cap clustered
beautiful blue-black curls, fine and glossy as a woman's
hair.</p>

<p>When Geraldine's appealing eyes met the admiring gaze
of this young man it paused and lingered as if held by
some irresistible attraction, and, advancing to her, he
lifted his blue cap courteously from his handsome head,
saying, kindly:</p>

<p>"You seem to be in trouble, miss. Can I help you?"</p>

<p>Thus encouraged by his kind look and tone, the girl faltered
out her distressing plight:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"My escort went back on shore to speak to a friend, and
was left behind. And I&mdash;I&mdash;don't know anybody&mdash;and
have no ticket&mdash;and no money with me!"</p>

<p>Poor, troubled baby! How charming she was with
those crimson cheeks and wet eyes, and that tremulous
quiver in her low voice! The handsome fireman's heart
went out to her so strongly that he longed to take her in
his arms like a child, and kiss away her pearly tears.</p>

<p>But of course, he didn't obey that strong impulse. He
only said, cordially:</p>

<p>"Don't let that little trifle worry you, miss. You must
permit me to buy you a ticket, and to take care of you to-day,
like a brother. Will you?"</p>

<p>How glad Geraldine was to find such a kind friend. Her
heart began to rebound from its depression, and she exclaimed,
gratefully:</p>

<p>"Oh, how can I thank you enough? I felt so frightened,
so like a lost child, till you spoke to me! Yes, I shall be
very grateful if you will buy me a ticket. I'll pay you
when we get back to New York. And&mdash;and&mdash;till then,
please keep this!"</p>

<p>She held out to him her sole ornament, a pretty little
ring, and insisted, against all his entreaties, that he should
hold it in pawn for her debt.</p>

<p>"You oughtn't to trust your engagement-ring to another
fellow," he said, lightly, as he slipped it over his little
finger.</p>

<p>Geraldine blushed brightly as she answered to this daring
challenge:</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not my engagement-ring at all. I'm not engaged."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to hear it," he replied, meaningly, then
proffered her his card, on which she read, in a clear, bold
chirography, the name: "<span class="smcap">Harry Hawthorne</span>."</p>

<p>Geraldine bowed, and said:</p>

<p>"I haven't a card, but my name is Miss Harding&mdash;Geraldine
Harding. I would like your address, please, so that
I may return your money to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I am usually at the engine-house on Ludlow street&mdash;Engine
Company No. 17. Driver, you see; and our splendid
horses&mdash;oh, but you ought to see how they love me,"
enthusiastically; then pulling himself up with a jerk;
"but, pray don't trouble to return the money. It will be
better for me to call, will it not, and return your ring?"</p>

<p>She assented, and gave him her address; then he found
her a seat, and as their boat plowed swiftly through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
frothing waves, they fell into a pleasant chat, during
which he said, courteously:</p>

<p>"I saw you come on board with Standish, the actor.
Are you a member of his company?"</p>

<p>"Not yet; but I hope to be one soon. I'm only a salesgirl
at O'Neill's now, but Mr. Standish has promised to
help me to become an actress."</p>

<p>She read distinct disapproval in his dark-blue eyes as he
said:</p>

<p>"But you will have to study a long while before you can
make your debut."</p>

<p>"No, for I've already studied a great deal, and acted
several parts in the amateur dramatic company to which I
belong. Mr. Standish says I can go right on as soon as I
secure a position."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will regret it if you go on the stage," he
observed, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; for it is the dream of my life!" smiled Geraldine.</p>

<p>"Will your friends permit it?"</p>

<p>"I'm only an orphan girl, earning her own living, so I
don't need to ask any one's leave. And I'm glad of that,
for I'm ambitious, and want to rise in life. I'm tired of
being the slave of the public at a dry-goods counter,"
cried Geraldine, with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>He gazed at her admiringly, but he did not hesitate to
say:</p>

<p>"It is only an exchange of slavery from the counter to
the stage. You will be the slave of the public still. If you
would listen to me, I would persuade you to remain where
you are&mdash;until some good man marries you, and makes
you the queen of his heart and home."</p>

<p>Geraldine tossed her shining head, and gave him a
saucy smile, and retorted:</p>

<p>"That sounds like my chum's preaching, but I shall not
listen to either of you. My heart is set on a stage career."</p>

<p>Harry Hawthorne gave her a grave look, but made no
reply in words, and for a few moments they kept silence,
while the gay, lilting music of the band filled up the
pauses, and the sun pierced through the fog and smiled
on the majestic steamer plowing her way through the
blue, sparkling waves.</p>

<p>Geraldine felt intuitively that he disapproved of her
plans, and maintained a pouting silence until he remarked,
genially:</p>

<p>"I have an idea!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked at him, questioningly, and he continued:</p>

<p>"The wife of our captain is on board to-day, going to
Newburgh. Now, wouldn't it be pleasant to introduce you,
so that she could look after you while I'm taking part in
the firemen's games?"</p>

<p>Geraldine felt as if he were tired of her already, and
eager to put her in charge of some one else, and her heart
sank with a strange pain, but she did not permit him to
see her mortification, she only gave an eager, smiling assent.</p>

<p>"I should like it very much, if the lady will be so
kind."</p>

<p>"Then I will go and bring Mrs. Stansbury, if you'll wait
here for us," and smiling at her, a friendly smile that
warmed her chilled heart like a burst of sudden sunshine, he
bowed himself away, and left the little beauty sitting
alone by the rail.</p>

<p>She leaned her elbows on the rail, her dimpled chin in
her hands, and watched the foamy waves with tender eyes
as she thought how bonny he was, her handsome new acquaintance.
Almost nicer, indeed, than Clifford Standish,
or at least he would be, but for his absurd prejudice
against her going on the stage.</p>

<p>"Won't Cissy be surprised when I have another handsome
caller? I suppose she'll be cross, and wonder where
I got another string to my bow," thought the budding
coquette, with artless vanity.</p>

<p>She decided not to tell Cissy of the actor's strange conduct,
for she would only say that he did it on purpose, and
that it served her right.</p>

<p>"And I shall not give her the chance to crow over me,
and say, 'I told you so!'" murmured Geraldine.</p>

<p>In the preoccupation of her mind, she did not notice
that the rail she leaned on was old and weak, and had
been mended at that very place. In the sudden indignation
at the thought of Cissy's contumacy, she leaned yet
more heavily upon it, and, with a sudden snap, the frail
support gave way, precipitating its lovely burden into the
water.</p>

<p>"Heaven have mercy!" shrieked poor Geraldine, as she
went downward over the side of the boat&mdash;down, down
down, into the churning, frothy waves.</p>

<p>In a moment all was terror, bustle, and confusion, the
passengers all crowding to the side to look over, almost
precipitating another accident in the excitement.</p>

<p>"Give way!" cried a stern, ringing voice, as the tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
form of the fireman pushed through the crowd, and he demanded,
hoarsely:</p>

<p>"What has happened?"</p>

<p>And a dozen voices answered that there had been an accident
to the young lady he had been with just now. The
rail on which she leaned had broken, throwing her into
the water.</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried, supplicatingly, and sprang over the
side to the rescue of the drowning girl!</p>

</div></div>


<p>Several moments of keenest suspense ensued, while the
noisy and excited crowd watched the water where Geraldine's
fair head had gone down beneath the surface.</p>

<p>Harry Hawthorne made a bold and gallant dive through
the eddying circles on the water, and for a few breathless
moments, he, too, was lost to sight.</p>

<p>The people shouted, in dismay and pity:</p>

<p>"They are both lost! They have been sucked under the
boat by the swift current!"</p>

<p>Every face grew sad at the thought, and some tender-hearted
women burst into tears.</p>

<p>It seemed terrible that those two beautiful young lives
should have gone down so suddenly and tragically into the
darkness of death.</p>

<p>But, suddenly, a low murmur of joy rose above the lamentations.</p>

<p>"See! see!"</p>

<p>The dark head of Harry Hawthorne had reappeared
above the waves.</p>

<p>In another moment it was seen that he held Geraldine
clasped to him with one arm, her white, unconscious face
and dripping hair upturned to the light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Supporting himself as best he could with one free arm,
he halooed, loudly:</p>

<p>"Boat! boat!"</p>

<p>Oh, what a ringing cheer answered him&mdash;shouts of joy
at the rescue; shouts of praise at his bravery!</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the steamer had been stopped, and a
little boat let down. The men rowed quickly to Hawthorne,
and drew him and his burden into safety.</p>

<p>The whole affair had passed off very quickly, but only
the strength and bravery of one man had saved pretty
Geraldine from a grave beneath the deep, sparkling waves
of the beautiful Hudson.</p>

<p>As it was, she had sustained no injury, and soon recovered
consciousness, looking about her with dazed eyes, to
find her rescuer kneeling by her side, gazing at her with
eager, dark-blue eyes, full of yearning anxiety.</p>

<p>"Oh, you need not look so frightened, Mr. Hawthorne.
She is all right now, and I'm going to take her down stairs
and lend her some of my dry clothes!" cried a gay voice,
and the pretty young married woman to whom he had
been about to introduce Geraldine when she fell into the
river, now took the girl in charge and led her down stairs,
saying, cheerily:</p>

<p>"You'll be all right directly. I'm going to get you some
wine, and have you lie down and rest a while when you
get on some dry clothes. Oh, you don't know my name, do
you?</p>

<p>"I am Mrs. Stansbury, and Harry Hawthorne was
bringing me over to see you when you fell into the water.
A mercy you wern't drowned, isn't it? You certainly
would have been, only for his bravery."</p>

<p>Closeted in the little state-room, she continued:</p>

<p>"How fortunate that I brought along a little steamer
trunk, expecting to spend several days with my mother in
Newburgh. I can lend you an outfit, for we are almost the
same size, aren't we? But I'll wager that Harry Hawthorne
will not be able to borrow a suit big enough for
him, and will have to remain 'in durance vile' until his
own clothes are dry."</p>

<p>Her words proved true, and she and Geraldine did not
see the handsome fireman again until just before they
landed, when he joined them, looking fresh and bright,
and none the worse for his ducking, excusing his absence
by saying, gayly, that he had been hung over a line to dry.</p>

<p>His eager eyes sought Geraldine's, and he said, tenderly:</p>

<p>"You feel no worse for your wetting, I hope?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, indeed, thanks to the coddling of Mrs. Stansbury
and the other ladies, but"&mdash;and her low voice broke with
grateful emotion&mdash;"how can I ever thank you enough?"</p>

<p>"Let my own keen joy in saving your life be my reward,"
he answered, lightly, but with an undercurrent of
joy in his deep, musical voice, for it seemed to him that
had she perished beneath the cruel, darkling waves, life
would never have seemed the same to him again.</p>

<p>Yet he knew that it might never be possible to win her
for his own. His rival, the handsome actor, might already
be lord of her girlish heart.</p>

<p>The bustle of landing cut short any further interchange
of words between them, and when they stepped on shore,
Mrs. Stansbury said, in her cordial way:</p>

<p>"I have claimed Miss Harding for my mother's guest,
and she will go with me to the ball to-night, and return to
New York with you to-morrow. Now, I see mamma's carriage
waiting. Will you come with us to luncheon before
we go out to the parade?"</p>

<p>"I thank you, no, for some of the fellows are waiting
for me now. But I will see you later. <i>Au revoir!</i>"</p>

<p>He smiled frankly at Geraldine, touched his cap, and
hurried away, seeming to take away some of the sunshine
with him, for her heart had gone out to him in a great
wave of tenderness that blotted out the memory of Clifford
Standish as though he had never existed.</p>

<p>She looked at her companion, and asked, naively:</p>

<p>"Why did you say I would go to the ball? I have no
dress to wear."</p>

<p>"What does that matter? I have several sisters. One
of them can lend you a white silk, I'm sure. Why, you
pretty darling, I wouldn't have you miss that ball for the
world! Perhaps you will meet your fate there!"</p>

<p>It seemed like a pretty act in a new play to Geraldine,
the crowding events of that delightful day.</p>

<p>To be welcomed so cordially by Mrs. Stansbury's gentle
mother, to ride through the crowded and gayly decorated
streets, in the private carriage, to the hospitable red brick
house full of pretty fun-loving girls, and to be installed
as an honored guest in a dainty chamber, was a treat to
the little working-girl whose life flowed in such a narrow
groove of toil and poverty, and she thought, generously:</p>

<p>"Oh, I am very fortunate to find such kind friends, and
I will always love them for their goodness to me. How I
wish Cissy had come with me, for she would enjoy this so
much."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stansbury entered with a great fluff of silk and lace
over her arm, saying, cheerily:</p>

<p>"Here's the ball-gown I promised for to-night&mdash;Carrie's
gown that she wore when she graduated last year. No,
she doesn't need it. She has a blue silk-and-chiffon affair
for the ball; so you'll be all right, won't you? And now
let's go and have our luncheon, for we must hurry down
town, where we have windows engaged to sit in and watch
the parade. Oh, dear, I'm so sorry that my hubby, the
captain, couldn't get away and come with us!"</p>

<p>They had a delightful luncheon, very enjoyable after
their morning on the water, then the party of six&mdash;Mrs.
Stansbury, her mother, Mrs. Odell, and her three daughters,
Carrie, Consuelo, and Daisy, with pretty Geraldine&mdash;set
out for the centre of attraction, Newburgh's "triangular
square" at the junction of Water and Colden streets. Here
the party had two large plate-glass windows over a splendid
dry-goods store. From this vantage ground the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
presented, as the magnificent parade filed past, was one to
be treasured long in memory.</p>

<p>It was a glittering spectacle, with thirty companies in
line, and almost as many bands. Newburgh had not seen
such a great day as this for years, with its glorious sunshine,
brilliant uniforms, dazzling apparatus, splendid
music, and throngs of appreciative people.</p>

<p>The crowd was enormous, the broad pavements packed
with a living mass of humanity; the door-ways, balconies,
windows, house-tops, a sea of faces. When the dazzling
pageant swept by, the effect was kaleidoscopic. The bright
gay uniforms of the fine-looking men, the beautiful caparisons
of the prancing horses, the heavily plated, imposing
engines, the light and graceful carriages, with their paintings
and stripings, their images and lamps, their glass-and-gold
reel-heads, their silver and gold jackets&mdash;all
gleamed and glittered in the flashing sunlight like an
Arabian Night's dream, and the hearty applause of the
gazing crowds made the welkin ring.</p>

<p>Geraldine was charmed with everything, and her lovely,
smiling face caught the upraised admiring glance of many
a gallant fireman as the long column of thirty companies
swept past to the ringing martial music of the accompanying
bands. She forgot all her resentment against Cissy in
her poignant regret that her chum was missing all this
splendor and enjoyment.</p>

<p>But, strange to say, not one regretful thought wandered
toward her lost cavalier, Clifford Standish.</p>

<p>She had forgotten him for the time, and her whole soul
was thrilled with the present&mdash;permeated, enraptured with
the thought of Harry Hawthorne, the handsome, dashing
fireman who had so nobly saved her life. She loved him
already, but she did not know her heart's language yet&mdash;her
heart that had already elected him its king.</p>

<p>What though his position was an humble one, it was
equal to hers, and Geraldine had never reflected that
beauty like her own ought to win her a fine rich lover.
She was in a whirl of bliss at the all-pervading thought
that she had met her fate at last.</p>

<p>"He is mine, and I am his," ran the secret voice of her
tender heart.</p>

<p>She watched the firemen eagerly as they paraded past,
hoping for a sight of his face among them, so she did not
hear the door open behind her until a hand touched her
shoulder and she looked up with a start, her voice unconsciously
betraying the rapture of her heart as she cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh-h-h!&mdash;I thought you were in the parade!"</p>

<p>He smiled, radiantly, his heart thrilling with joy.</p>

<p>"No, I am not in the parade. That is, I chose not to be.
You see, my company did not come, to take part, only a
few of us fellows, so we can do as we like. We were
offered seats in the carriages with the visiting firemen,
and the others accepted. But I&mdash;I thought I would return
and remain with you ladies."</p>

<p>His voice said "ladies," but his eyes said "you," and
Geraldine thrilled deliciously.</p>

<p>Oh, how gay and happy she felt&mdash;happier than she had
ever been in her whole life before. The dawn of love made
the whole world roseate with sunshine.</p>

<p>And never had she looked more beautiful. The joy in
her heart sent the warm blood leaping through her veins
and made her eyes brighter, her cheeks redder, until she
was dazzlingly lovely.</p>

<p>Harry Hawthorne remained with the party all the rest
of the afternoon. Other young men joined them presently,
admirers of the pretty Odell girls, and later on they repaired
to the County Fair Grounds to witness some of the
firemen's games taking place there.</p>

<p>Seated on the grand stand, by the side of Geraldine,
Harry Hawthorne felt as proud and happy as a king, for
the same sweet wine of Love that thrilled the girl flowed
intoxicatingly through his veins.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For what was it else within me wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But, I fear, the new strong wine of Love,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That made my tongue to stammer and trip<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When I saw the treasured splendor, her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Come sliding out of her sacred glove,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As the sunlight broke from her lip?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The tournament and games of this afternoon were only
a repetition by Newburgh firemen of the ones that had
been participated in the previous day by the visiting companies&mdash;"consolation
races," the chief merrily called
them.</p>

<p>But the grand stand was packed and the entertainment
was novel and interesting, as evidenced by the frequent
applause of the crowd.</p>

<p>The exercises after the pretty tournament consisted
mainly of hose-racing contests, in which firemanic skill
was displayed at its best.</p>

<p>"You must explain the game to me. You see, I never
thought much about firemen before, although I am deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
interested in them now," pretty Geraldine said, naively, to
her delighted companion.</p>

<p>He thanked her with a kindling glance of pleasure, and
answered:</p>

<p>"It will give me pleasure to explain it all to you, Miss
Harding. It is very simple indeed, depending on the skill
and dexterity of the men. In the first place, the rules of
the game require fifteen men. They must run two hundred
yards to the hydrant, with a hose cart, and from that
point lay one hundred yards of hose, make a coupling, and
screw on the pipe. But these technical terms are Greek to
you, of course, so I will try to make it clear to you as they
proceed."</p>

<p>He did so, and Geraldine, who was beginning to love
all firemen, for the sake of the splendid one by her side,
watched the contest with breathless interest.</p>

<p>But now arose a difficulty.</p>

<p>The Newburgh company had only fourteen good runners,
and they must have a fifteenth one.</p>

<p>But the rules of the race required that no company
should make use of the services of a member of another
company.</p>

<p>It was finally decided that as the race was not for a
prize, but simply for practice and amusement, the rule
might be waived for one in favor of a visiting fireman.</p>

<p>Then a murmur arose among the firemen that suddenly
swelled to a clamorous shout:</p>

<p>"Hawthorne! Hawthorne!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stansbury, who sat on the other side of Geraldine,
looked round, and exclaimed, gayly:</p>

<p>"They are calling you, Mr. Hawthorne. Why don't you
go?"</p>

<p>"I prefer remaining here," he smiled back, though a
slight flush rose to his brow as the calls continued more
clamorously:</p>

<p>"Hawthorne! Hawthorne! Hawthorne!"</p>

<p>All eyes turned on him as he sat unmoved, and a delegation
of firemen came to insist on his joining the race.</p>

<p>"Oh, do go, Mr. Hawthorne. I think it will be grand to
join the race!" exclaimed Geraldine, enthusiastically, and
he rose at once like a gallant knight who has no other wish
than to do the behest of his lady-love.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stansbury whispered as he went away:</p>

<p>"He will win the race for them. He is a magnificent
athlete, my husband says. And as for horses&mdash;well, you
should see him control them! They love and obey him like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
a master, and he has a passion for them. He is a splendid
fellow, though there is something rather mysterious about
him. He has been driver for No. 17 two years, yet no
one knows where he came from or aught about his
family. But he is educated above his position, and has
betrayed that he has lived abroad. We think he is English
or Irish&mdash;perhaps a mixture of both. But, anyway, he is
just magnificent, and the men and the horses both worship
him alike. He has been a hero at dozens of fires, and has
several medals of honor, but he will not accept promotion.
He says he loves the horses, and will not give up driving.
But look! the team is about to start!"</p>

<p>Every word she uttered only made Geraldine love Hawthorne
more dearly, for what woman does not love a hero?</p>

<p>Geraldine watched the contest with flashing eyes; but,
needless to say, she saw but one man, and she soon realized
that the most thunderous applause was given to him.</p>

<p>"He is the swiftest runner of them all!" cried Carrie
Odell. "Look how the men are dropping off! They cannot
stand it. Seven, eight, nine, ten, have given up. Oh-h-h!"</p>

<p>"Another! And another!" cried her sister, Consuelo,
and so it kept on till when they reached the finish they
had only two men to open the hydrant, and screw on the
pipe&mdash;a simple operation it would seem to a novice, but it
is just here that the race is won or lost. Under the moment's
excitement the couplers will likely find their nerves
unsteady after the long run. But these two men made no
false moves. They put on the pipe with indescribable
speed, then ran on the remaining hundred yards to the
judge's stand, Harry Hawthorne coming out ahead amid
the deafening cheers of his admirers.</p>

<p>The judges took the time at the very instant that the
pipe touched the ground, and after examining the coupling
they found it all right, and announced the time as forty-six
and one-fourth seconds.</p>

<p>The victors retired amid tumultuous applause, and another
team prepared to run, Hawthorne returning very
soon to Geraldine's side to sun himself in her admiring
eyes.</p>

<p>"You were splendid, and I was proud of you!" she cried,
innocently, unconscious of the tenderness her words implied.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I am proud that I pleased you; but I was
sorry they made me run. I was trying to keep rested and
fresh to dance with you at the ball to-night," he answered,
lightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"And now you will be too tired&mdash;I am sorry for that."</p>

<p>How frankly she could talk to him, and yet they had
been strangers only this morning; yet it seemed as if they
had known each other years and years.</p>

<p>"No, I shall not be too weary to dance with you," he
answered, tenderly.</p>

<p>Then others of the party claimed his attention, and Geraldine
sat in a happy dream, thinking how heavenly it
would be dancing with him to-night.</p>

<p>Presently the games were over, and the weary, happy
throng departed&mdash;the Odells and their guests to make
ready for the grand fireman's ball they were going to attend
that night.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wonder what Cissy will say when I don't come
back to-night? She will be uneasy about me; perhaps angry.
But she will forgive me when I tell her how it happened,
and what a lovely time I had," thought Geraldine.</p>

<p>But again she did not even think of Clifford Standish, or
even wonder what had become of him. She was full of the
dear, delightful present.</p>

<p>How delightful it was to be dressing for a grand ball,
in white slippers and a fairy-like gown of white silk, and
with white roses for her breast and hair. Geraldine felt like
a Cinderella going to the ball with a prince, for Harry
Hawthorne was coming to be her escort, and to her he
was the handsomest man on earth, a veritable Prince
Charming.</p>

<p>She looked at her reflection in the long mirror, with artless
delight at her own beauty.</p>

<p>"How pretty I look! I hope he will think so, too, but
perhaps he knows some one more beautiful," she murmured,
uneasily.</p>

</div></div>


<p>Oh, how Geraldine enjoyed the first two hours of the
ball!</p>

<p>It was one of the most brilliant affairs ever given in
Newburgh.</p>

<p>The dazzling lights shone on an animated scene, adorned
with rich floral garnitures, and brightened by the rich
uniforms of the firemen, mixed with the sober black of the
ordinary citizen, and the gay gowns of the beautiful
women.</p>

<p>Geraldine, with her golden fluff of hair, bright brown
eyes, and shining white attire, was the cynosure of all
eyes, and many a gallant fireman envied Harry Hawthorne,
who was her partner so often in the joyous dance.</p>

<p>True, she would dance with any of them to whom he introduced
her, but each one saw by the wandering glances
of her brown eyes that Hawthorne was first in her heart
and thoughts.</p>

<p>So the first two hours passed by like a dream of bliss.</p>

<p>Geraldine loved music and dancing and gayety, with all
her heart. She loved, too, the congenial new friends she
had made, and lost in the delightful present, she forgot for
a time her feverish ambition to become an actress and
shine upon the stage.</p>

<p>What exquisite rapture may be crowded into two hours&mdash;rapture
that will linger in the memory till death blots
out all. So it was with Geraldine.</p>

<p>When Hawthorne pressed her hand in the dance, and
looked into her eyes, drinking in deep draughts the intoxication
of her beauty and sweetness, the girl thrilled with
a rapture akin to pain, and those moments of dizzy, subtle
bliss so dazzling in their brightness, returned to Geraldine
through all her life as her happiest hours&mdash;that hour in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
woman's life when First Love "is a shy, sweet new-comer,
and Hope leads it by the hand."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"New hopes may bloom, and days may come,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of milder, calmer beam;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But there's nothing half so sweet in life<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As love's young dream."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How sad that a shadow should fall so suddenly over
Geraldine's happiness!</p>

<p>But as she stood at a window, panting from the dance,
rosy and smiling, as she talked to Harry Hawthorne, a
shadow suddenly came between her and the light, pausing
by her side till she looked up and saw&mdash;Clifford Standish!</p>

<p>Alas! that his shadow should ever come between her and
the dawning happiness of her life!</p>

<p>Alas! that she had ever met him, the handsome, unscrupulous
actor, who stood there scowling at his splendid
rival!</p>

<p>"Mr. Standish!" she exclaimed, with a violent start, and
a strange feeling of annoyance, and he answered, impressively:</p>

<p>"How glad I am that I have found you at last!"</p>

<p>"Have you been looking for me?" she asked, coldly.</p>

<p>"Everywhere! And I beg ten thousand pardons for my
seeming desertion of you. It was wholly an accident, and
the fault of my friend, who detained me talking one minute
too long. I followed you on the next steamer, but it
was several hours late, and all the time my mind was distracted
over what would become of you. Of course I knew
you would find friends&mdash;a beautiful girl alone in a crowd
will always find a protector; but," sneeringly, "not always
a safe one!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. It was I who protected Miss
Harding," began Harry Hawthorne, wrathfully, and the
girl started, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Mr. Standish, this is Mr. Hawthorne, a very kind gentleman
who paid my fare on the boat after you left me
without a ticket, and afterward jumped into the river and
saved my life when I fell overboard. I owe him a debt of
gratitude that I can never repay."</p>

<p>They bowed coldly, trying not to glare, each seeing in
the other a dangerous rival.</p>

<p>Clifford Standish was not pleasant to look at with that
steely glare in his large, light-blue eyes, and that angry
compression of his shaven lips as he said, coldly:</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir, for your care of my friend during my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
enforced absence from her side. I will repay you the boat
fare, and remain deeply indebted to you for saving her
life. Of course it goes without saying that I shall now be
honored with her company again, thus relieving you of
her care."</p>

<p>Harry Hawthorne, with a dangerous flash in his dark-blue
eyes, retorted, calmly:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. Her engagement with me for this
evening gives me a right that I shall not relinquish unless
at her desire."</p>

<p>Both looked at the beautiful, flushed face of the girl.
She comprehended the sudden hate between them, and
said, tremblingly, but with the sweet tones of the peacemaker:</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Hawthorne is right. My engagement with
you was for to-day, and we were to have returned to-night,
you know. But after you left me alone on the boat, I made
new friends, and a very sweet, kind lady, well-known to
Mr. Hawthorne, took charge of me and invited me to be
her guest while I staid in Newburgh. It was under her
chaperonage I came to the ball, and, with her consent, I
accepted the escort of Mr. Hawthorne. I cannot break my
engagement with him, and I have promised, also, to go
back to New York in his care to-morrow."</p>

<p>Every word she uttered maddened him with secret fury.
His face was livid as he almost hissed:</p>

<p>"I should like to see this lady who chaperoned you
here. How do I know that she is a proper person!" he began,
insolently, but at that moment a lady tapped him
smartly on the arm with her fan, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! I like that, Mr. Standish! A proper person
indeed. Well, I'm the person, and if you have any fault to
find with me, my husband, Captain Stansbury, will settle
it with you."</p>

<p>"Miss Odell!" he exclaimed, recoiling in surprise from
the sight of the face of an old acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stansbury, please," she corrected him, then went
on, gayly: "Do you remember our flirtation at Asbury
Park three years ago? I haven't seen you since, have I?
Well, I've been married two years now to the finest man
in New York. But my sisters are single yet. Come with
me and pay your respects to them before the german
begins."</p>

<p>She dragged him reluctantly away, and then Hawthorne
said, angrily:</p>

<p>"That fellow was inclined to be insolent, and I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
scarcely refrain from pitching him neck and heels through
this window!"</p>

<p>"Oh, please, please, do not get into any trouble with
him on my account!" pleaded Geraldine. "He has been
very kind to me, really, and I should not wish to offend
him!"</p>

<p>"Do not tell me he is your lover&mdash;that you care for
him!" exclaimed the young man, jealously.</p>

<p>"N-n-o, he is only a friend!" she faltered, and was glad
when her partner for the next dance came to claim her
hand.</p>

<p>She knew in her heart that Clifford Standish regarded
her with more than a friendly liking, but she was not prepared
to own it to impetuous Harry Hawthorne, so she
was glad to get away from his inquisitive looks and words.</p>

<p>But the joy of the evening was ended now for pretty
Geraldine.</p>

<p>Clifford Standish soon escaped from the Odell girls, and
haunted Geraldine the rest of the time, not offensively,
but with the assurance of a favored lover, torturing the
poor girl who could not bear to wound his feelings, but
whose reserved and distrait manner did not discourage his
persistent gallantry, for he stood his ground, debarring
the lovers from any pleasure in each other's society.</p>

<p>Once Hawthorne whispered to her, fiercely:</p>

<p>"There comes that cad back. He is annoying you. I see
it by your altered looks. Will you not allow me to pitch
him out of the window?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh, no, you must not make a scene!" she shuddered,
apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Then tell him yourself that you are weary of his persistent
following," he urged.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I cannot wound him so. He has been kind to
me, and means no harm," she said, trying to make excuses
that she felt he did not deserve.</p>

<p>But she escaped from the ball as soon as she could, glad
to be rid of him, and spent a restless night, repenting the
encouragement she had given Standish before she met
Hawthorne.</p>

<p>"They both love me, and I can see that they will be bitter
foes," she thought, in terror of some unknown evil.</p>

<p>The next morning Standish came at an early hour to
call. He was acquainted with the girls, and they tried by
merry banter to drive the threatening gloom from his
brow; but all their efforts were dismal failures. He had
eyes only for Geraldine, who was pale and perturbed under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
his reproachful glances, that seemed to say, bitterly:</p>

<p>"You are a cruel little coquette. You encouraged me to
love you until you met that other fellow, and now you wish
to throw me over."</p>

<p>It was a great relief to Geraldine when Harry Hawthorne
arrived with a cab to take her to the boat. Now at
last she could escape her angry lover.</p>

<p>He rose, indeed, to take leave of the family, but he said
to her:</p>

<p>"I shall see you again, Miss Harding. I go back to New
York on the same boat."</p>

<p>He did so, but he did not judge it prudent to incur the
wrath of Hawthorne by too persistent attentions. He preserved
a coolly courteous demeanor toward both, devoting
himself to some other friends whom he met on the boat.</p>

<p>But, toward the last, he approached Geraldine again,
murmuring, pleadingly:</p>

<p>"I should like to call on you this evening, if you will
permit me."</p>

<p>She blushed, and stammered:</p>

<p>"Please excuse me, as I have another engagement."</p>

<p>He saw her timid glance turn toward Hawthorne, and
readily guessed that she had made an engagement with
him.</p>

<p>Stifling an execration between closely drawn lips, he
muttered:</p>

<p>"To-morrow evening, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, certainly," she answered, but with an air of
restraint that made him furious.</p>

<p>"She would like to refuse if she dared, the little flirt,"
he thought, and when Geraldine and Hawthorne left the
boat together, he looked after them pale with rage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment Cameron Clemens, one of the actor-friends
he had met on the boat, slapped him on the shoulder,
and said, teasingly:</p>

<p>"Hallo, Standish! that was a stunning little beauty! But
what are you glowering at, man? Jealous, eh?"</p>

<p>"Jealous of a beggarly fireman? Bah, no! The little
coquette will throw him over to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And pick you up again, eh? Consolatory, by Jove! But
who is she, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nobody but a salesgirl from O'Neill's. She scraped
acquaintance with me in the store some ten days ago, and
has been begging me to get her in my company ever since.
You know how the pretty girls always run after actors,
Clemens."</p>

<p>"And how ardently the actors encourage their attentions;
oh, yes," smiled the other, who was a very handsome
young fellow himself. He added, after a moment:
"Is the girl stage-struck?"</p>

<p>"Yes, decidedly&mdash;member of an amateur dramatic society,
and all that, you know. Wild to go on the stage, and
I intend to get her in our company, just before we go on
the road next week."</p>

<p>"But there's no vacancy."</p>

<p>"I'll get that little soubrette turned off. I owe her a
grudge anyhow. She slapped my face when I tried to kiss
her in a dark corridor one night."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't take revenge for that. She's a good little girl,
that Bettie," said Cameron Clemens, who, although he was
the villain in the play where Standish had the part of
hero, was kind and generous at heart.</p>

<p>But Clifford Standish could not be brought to relent.</p>

<p>"She can get another place," he said, carelessly. "The
manager can't afford to displease me. I'm drawing full
houses every night. So out goes prudish Bettie, and in
comes pretty Geraldine!"</p>

<p>"You don't think you can kiss her in a dark corridor, do
you?"</p>

<p>"I shall kiss her when I please. In fact, I intend to marry
the little beauty; so no attentions in that quarter, my
friend."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll keep off the grass," returned the young
actor, slangily, and turning to his friend, Charlie Butler,
they went away together, leaving Standish to some bitter
reflections, for his bravado was all put on. He feared that
Geraldine was lost to him forever.</p>

<p>"He will be with her this evening, that villainous fireman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
while I am plodding away on the stage," he thought,
angrily.</p>

<p>But a most untoward fate helped him on when he feared
that the game was lost to him forever&mdash;helped him on, and
blighted all the springing hopes of poor Harry Hawthorne.</p>

<p>A morbid curiosity over his rival led him to stroll down
on Ludlow street that afternoon, in the neighborhood of
the engine-house, and he saw the horses dashing out attached
to the engine, and the hated Hawthorne on the
driver's seat, handling the reins with consummate skill,
his handsome face aglow with excitement. An alarm of
fire had come in, and he was hastening to the scene.</p>

<p>Clifford Standish hated his manly rival more than ever
at this moment, but he impulsively joined the crowd that
was running after the engine, intent on seeing the fire.</p>

<p>On went the engine in splendid style, the horses obeying
Hawthorne's hand lovingly, their sleek sides shining, their
manes streaming, their fine heads erect, their large eyes
flashing, a sight to win the admiration of every gazer.
Flying like the wind, their hoofs striking fire from the
pavement, they turned the corner, and&mdash;&mdash; Alas! what
was that shriek that went up from hundreds of throats?</p>

<p>Their splendid onset was defeated. In turning the corner
the wheels struck a car track at an angle, and the engine
was overturned, the gallant steeds struggling in the dust
with their noble driver.</p>

<p>Clifford Standish rushed forward with demoniac glee,
muttering:</p>

<p>"My rival is dead beneath the engine! I am free of him
forever!"</p>

<p>It almost seemed as if Clifford Standish was destined to
realize his diabolical hopes of his rival's death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>When Harry Hawthorne was drawn from his perilous
position at the heels of the horses, he was found to be unconscious,
and the blood pouring from a wound on his
head.</p>

<p>An ambulance was called to convey him to the hospital,
and the physician in charge looked very serious over the
case.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to say yet whether he is mortally injured
or not. He may simply be stunned from the bad cut
on his head, or he may have sustained internal injuries,"
he said to the anxious crowd about him, and then the
wounded man was lifted carefully into the ambulance, and
driven to the Bellevue Hospital.</p>

<p>Clifford Standish turned away from the scene with a
diabolical smile of triumph on his thin lips, hissing
cruelly:</p>

<p>"The Fates have played me a good turn, and I will make
the most of my opportunity. Whether Harry Hawthorne
lives or dies, I will come between him and Geraldine so
effectually that when he returns to her it will be impossible
to win her from me. Of course, I shall not go near her
this evening. She must be kept in ignorance of his accident,
if possible, so that she may think he has forsaken
her. Ha, ha, ha! what a weary waiting she will have for
him this evening, and how angry she will be because he
has broken his engagement."</p>

<p>Geraldine did, indeed, have a weary waiting for her
lover, and her disappointment was keen and bitter at his
failure to come.</p>

<p>But so absolute was her faith in him that she did not
become angry, but thought, excusingly:</p>

<p>"Something has happened to detain him, surely. Perhaps
he was called out to some dreadful fire. I shall be
sure to receive a note from him to-morrow, explaining all,
craving my pardon, and appointing another date to call."</p>

<p>She was so anxious, too, for Cissy to see him. She felt
sure that her friend would like him better than she had
liked Clifford Standish.</p>

<p>When she reached home that day, she rested a while,
then went down to the store, and remained until closing
time, returning with Cissy, who was cold and indifferent,
for Geraldine's non-return the night before had filled her
with alarm over the fate of the willful girl.</p>

<p>But Geraldine, eager for her friend's sympathy, put
aside her former petulance, and poured into Cissy's ear
the story of the day and night&mdash;the accident that had deprived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
her of the actor's company&mdash;the new friends she
had made, her fall into the water, her rescue, her charming
time at Newburgh&mdash;except that her girlish heart had
gone from her own keeping into that of noble, handsome,
tender Harry Hawthorne.</p>

<p>But Cissy did not need to be told the latter. She read it
in the blush and smile of the innocent girl.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"How does Love speak?<br /></span>

<span class="i16">Thus doth Love speak!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Oh, Cissy, I want you to promise me to come in and see
him to-night," pleaded Geraldine, humbly. "I am sure
you will be charmed with him, he is so good and so handsome."</p>

<p>"So you said of Mr. Standish," reminded Cissy.</p>

<p>Geraldine blushed, but answered, warmly:</p>

<p>"I know I did; but&mdash;Mr. Hawthorne is nicer than the
actor&mdash;oh, ever so much nicer! And"&mdash;slyly&mdash;"you will
like him, Cissy, because he is as much opposed to my
going on the stage as you are."</p>

<p>"Then I shall cultivate his acquaintance," declared
Cissy, beamingly.</p>

<p>And she was almost as anxious for his coming that night
as Geraldine was herself.</p>

<p>But, as we have seen, both were disappointed.</p>

<p>Harry Hawthorne lay ill and suffering at the hospital,
and there was no one to tell Geraldine the story of his accident.</p>

<p>Her young heart was heavy with pain and wonder all
the next day, but still no message came to explain or excuse
his failure to keep his engagement.</p>

<p>Only some fair young girl as loving and tender as our
sweet Geraldine, who has been disappointed as she was,
can realize her silent grief that day as she stood behind
the counter, patiently waiting on exacting customers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
trying to seem cheerful and interested when she was longing
to be alone in her own room, to bury her head in the
pillow and have a good, comforting cry.</p>

<p>She was wretched with doubt and suspense.</p>

<p>And only yesterday she had been so wildly happy.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Clifford Standish came into the
store to buy a pair of gloves.</p>

<p>He was bright, smiling, and elegant as ever, and chatted
gayly with Geraldine.</p>

<p>"I have some good news for you this evening," he whispered,
but the girl scarcely smiled.</p>

<p>She knew that he would not bring her any tidings of
Harry Hawthorne, and it seemed to her that she cared for
nothing else.</p>

<p>How strange is love when it enters the heart as a guest,
shutting out interest in everything else&mdash;strange, subtle,
sweet, and absorbingly selfish.</p>

<p>Geraldine forgot how well she had liked the actor, and
how she had quarreled with Cissy for his sake.</p>

<p>His attentions were repugnant to her now, and she
wished ardently to be rid of him.</p>

<p>But her tender, girlish heart reproached her for her
fickleness, and she thought it would seem ungrateful to
snub him now.</p>

<p>So she only smiled at him plaintively, assuming an interest
she did not feel.</p>

<p>Bending across the counter, he whispered, so that Cissy
could not hear:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, but did your new admirer&mdash;did he
call last night?"</p>

<p>"No-o," faltered the girl, and she could hardly keep the
tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, that is strange. What prevented him from keeping
his engagement?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"You have not heard from him?" he exclaimed, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Not a word," she sighed, then added, quickly: "But I
don't think he meant to break his engagement. Perhaps
there was a fire, and he had to go."</p>

<p>"Very likely&mdash;but, then, he should have sent you an
apology early this morning."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? Oh, I suppose he will come and explain
in person," said Geraldine, with assumed indifference.</p>

<p>Another customer bustled up to claim her attention, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
he bowed himself away, secretly exultant over the fact
that she was utterly ignorant of Harry Hawthorne's fate.</p>

<p>"There is no one to come and tell her, and even if it gets
into the papers, she is not likely to read it. A poor working-girl
has little time for reading," he reflected.</p>

<p>Again his evil genius favored him.</p>

<p>When he went for his call on Geraldine that evening, he
found a messenger-boy in the street with a letter for her
from the Bellevue Hospital.</p>

<p>He took the letter from the boy, and gave him a quarter.</p>

<p>"I am going in to see Miss Harding now. I will deliver
the letter," he said, affably, and the boy, who was in a
hurry to get home to his supper, thanked him for the service,
and turned away, rejoicingly.</p>

<p>The triumphant actor hid the letter in his breast, congratulating
himself on having so easily obtained possession
of it.</p>

<p>"I am very fortunate, for had the fickle little beauty received
it, all would have been explained between them."</p>

<p>Geraldine came to the door to receive him, and he saw
at once how much she had changed toward him by the
simple fact that she had not adorned herself in her best
gown, as usual, but wore her simple shop-gown of black
serge.</p>

<p>She did not care whether she looked fair to him or not,
and he quickly realized it, for he was an adept in reading
the complex nature of woman. But he hid his chagrin,
saying, admiringly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do not realize how pretty and demure you
look in that black gown."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Geraldine said, listlessly, as she sank into
a chair opposite, and tried to seem friendly and interested.</p>

</div></div>


<p>It made Clifford Standish secretly furious to see how
near he had come to losing the charming little beauty on
whom he had set his burning heart, and of whom he had
felt so sure but a few days ago.</p>

<p>Her pale and pensive looks, her drooping eyes, her
pathetic red mouth, all told that her heart was far away,
and in his heart he cursed himself for inviting her to go
on that fateful excursion to Newburgh, by which he had
almost lost her forever.</p>

<p>But he had one chance now to retrieve his misstep, and
he set about improving it.</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell you the promised good news!" he exclaimed.
"I have at last secured you the wished-for position
in my company."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Geraldine, starting, and clasping her little
hands convulsively together.</p>

<p>But the exclamation was one of dismay rather than of
joy.</p>

<p>His quick ear detected it, but he pretended to misapprehend
her, and continued:</p>

<p>"I knew you would be delighted to hear it."</p>

<p>"Ye-es," she faltered, weakly; then bracing herself to
escape the engagement. "But&mdash;but&mdash;perhaps I ought not
to go on the stage. Cissy is opposed to it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know&mdash;you told me that at first, but you said,
also, that you did not care for her opinions&mdash;that you
should do as you pleased."</p>

<p>Geraldine could not contradict him. It was perfectly
true.</p>

<p>She sat speechless and embarrassed, feeling like a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
bird caught in the fowler's net, while he continued,
smoothly:</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid of Miss Carroll's displeasure. It's only
envy and jealousy."</p>

<p>Geraldine, in her resentment against Cissy, had said
this to him, too, and she comprehended that he was cleverly
turning her own weapons against her now. She could
only sit mute and miserable, with a forced smile that was
more pathetic than tears.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'If I could leave this smile,' she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'And take a moan upon my mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And let my tears run smooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It were the happier way,' she said."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Clifford Standish continued:</p>

<p>"The position offered you is not as good as I could wish,
but I shall manage to get you a promotion soon. Our soubrette
is going to leave, and you can take her place as soon
as you wish."</p>

<p>It was strange how tenaciously Geraldine's mind clung
to the dread of Harry Hawthorne's disapproval. She did
not wish to go on the stage now, and was eager for a loophole
to escape.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think I'd like to take a soubrette's place,"
she cried.</p>

<p>"But last week you said you wouldn't mind it."</p>

<p>"Oh, why do you keep throwing up things I said last
week?" she burst out, pettishly.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to forget them so soon, Miss Harding?
Then you must be very fickle-minded, and I am sorry that
I had that poor soubrette discharged for your sake!"</p>

<p>"For my sake! Oh-h-oh!"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly; because you were so anxious for a
place, and I wished to please you above all things," tenderly;
"and, of course, you know the manager dare not
refuse anything reasonable that I ask, so I persuaded him
to discharge poor Bettina."</p>

<p>"Oh, let her keep the place, do! It was cruel to turn her
off."</p>

<p>"It is too late to replace her now. She has accepted an
offer from a company that is going to remain in New
York, and I shall have no end of trouble getting another
girl to fill the place. I thought you wanted the chance so
badly," reproachfully.</p>

<p>Geraldine flushed crimson, and the tears she had been
fighting back brimmed over in her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I have acted abominably," she sobbed; "but&mdash;but&mdash;a
girl has a right to change her mind, hasn't she?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if she doesn't mind putting every one out,"
stiffly.</p>

<p>He rose as if to go, walked to the door as if in anger,
then relented, and stood looking back with intense eyes
that compelled her to look at him deprecatingly.</p>

<p>Having gained this point, he said, gently:</p>

<p>"We are going on the road with our company in one
week, and as our soubrette can stay with us a few days
longer, I'll give you three days to make up your mind
whether you will take the place or not. For who knows
but that you will change your mind again?" and still smiling
kindly at her, he quoted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis helpless woman's right divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her dearest right&mdash;Caprice!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Please go now," she answered, burying her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>"I am going now, but I shall come back to-morrow
evening, and hope to find you in a brighter mood," he answered,
going out softly and closing the door.</p>

<p>He had purposely refrained from speaking of Harry
Hawthorne, but he guessed well that it was he who had
influenced her against the stage.</p>

<p>"Curse his meddling! But it shall avail him nothing. I
shall conquer in the end. I have sworn to make her mine,
and mine she shall be, the coquettish little darling," he
muttered, resolutely.</p>

<p>The days came and went, while Geraldine waited patiently
for the coming of Harry Hawthorne&mdash;waited all in
vain, for he continued very ill at the hospital, and the
note he had dictated to a nurse acquainting her with his
accident she never received. It had fallen into the hands
of his triumphant rival, Standish, who kept it hidden
safely from that yearning young heart.</p>

<p>Two more days passed by, and still Geraldine heard
nothing of Harry Hawthorne.</p>

<p>"Is it not strange&mdash;the way he has acted?" she said, at
last, to Cissy, who answered:</p>

<p>"Yes; he has behaved so shabbily that you ought to put
him out of your thoughts, dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, Cissy, do you believe that he never meant to come?
That he was unworthy?" almost piteously.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so, Geraldine, for even if something had
happened to keep him away that evening, he has had
ample time to explain and apologize since then; but he
has not done so, and it looks as if he was a sad flirt, and
only amused himself with you for the time, without giving
you another thought since he left you."</p>

<p>Cissy believed what she said, and meant only kindness,
but her frank words quivered like a thorn in Geraldine's
heart.</p>

<p>Oh, how could she think of him as an unprincipled flirt,
awakening an interest in a young girl's heart only for his
own amusement?</p>

<p>But still she knew that such men existed, and that many
broken hearts lay at their door.</p>

<p>The dread that Harry Hawthorne might be one of these
heartless men awoke to life within her a fierce and burning
pride.</p>

<p>"No man shall break my heart. I will forget Harry
Hawthorne," she vowed, bitterly, to herself; and when
the actor came that night, he found her bright and gay as
of yore. She had put on over her tortured heart that mask
of smiles which many a woman wears through life to deceive
a carping world.</p>

<p>Clifford Standish was charmed with her new mood. He
saw that a reaction had begun.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you so happy, for I am sure that you
have decided to go on the road with us," he exclaimed,
coaxingly.</p>

<p>She shook her head, and laughed, gayly:</p>

<p>"Do not be too sure. You know you have given me until
Sunday night to decide."</p>

<p>"But that is not far off&mdash;only twenty-four hours," he
said, with a smile, for he felt sure of victory. As she made
no reply, he continued:</p>

<p>"I have made a charming invitation for you for Sunday
afternoon. Some of the leading members of our company
are going to skate in the park to-morrow&mdash;you know this
cold snap has frozen the lake beautifully&mdash;and they want
me to bring you. Will you come?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Geraldine, quickly, glad of a diversion
for Sunday afternoon, so that she need not mope alone
with her miserable thoughts of how Harry Hawthorne had
flirted with her for his own amusement.</p>

<p>For she had begun to lose faith in her handsome lover
now. The leaven of Cissy's words had worked steadily in
her mind.</p>

<p>And a cruel self-shame that she had given her love in
vain was at war with the tenderness of her heart.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I am so glad you will go. I know you will
like the trip and the company," he said; then, in a
changed tone: "By the way, did that fireman ever keep
his promise to call on you?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Have you heard anything about him?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, and I had almost forgotten the man until
you recalled him to my mind," she returned, fibbing unblushingly.</p>

<p>"Ah! Then you will not mind what I have to tell you?"
deprecatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course not. What is it?" carelessly.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, I thought it rude and strange his not
keeping his appointment with you, and thinking something
might have happened to the fellow, as you feared, I
made some indirect inquiries at the engine-house, and
found that he had returned to Newburgh the same day he
brought you back to New York."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" she returned, with a paling cheek, whose
pallor she could not control.</p>

<p>"Yes, he had gone back, but I did not like to tell you the
truth. I waited for developments. But, to-day, I met Mrs.
Stansbury on the street, and she told me something&mdash;well,
see if you can guess?"</p>

<p>"Something very amusing, no doubt," she replied, carelessly.</p>

<p>"She told me she had just returned from Newburgh,
and that she had left Hawthorne there, courting her sister,
Daisy Odell. It seemed that he had been in love with the
pretty little black-eyed thing some time, and fearing that
she might get jealous of the attentions he had to pay you
the day you were thrown on his care by my accidental desertion,
he returned to make his peace with her, and has
been lingering by her side ever since. Mrs. Stansbury was
vastly amused over it all, and said to me, 'He flirted
shockingly with that pretty little salesgirl, didn't he? but
I hope she knew it was only fun! Give my love to her
when you see her again!'"</p>

<p>Geraldine treated the matter with a seeming careless
indifference, but, oh! the tumult of wounded love and
pride that raged within her girlish breast!</p>

<p>"I was so fond of that woman, and she was only kind to
me for the sake of a little amusement," she thought, with
hot and burning cheeks at his tone when he repeated Mrs.
Stansbury's contemptuous epithet, "that little salesgirl!"</p>

<p>To herself she said, angrily:</p>

<p>"I will not be a poor salesgirl any longer, to be twitted
with my humble position in life. I will become an actress,
and my talents will make me famous, so that these people
will go to see me act, and be proud to say, 'I knew her
once, but she is so rich and grand now that she would not
stoop to renew the acquaintance.' As for Harry Hawthorne,
who knows but that I may be able to pay him
back some day for the slight he put on me! I am no longer
grateful to him for saving my life; for why should he
have saved it, only to plant a thorn in my heart?"</p>

<p>But she did not tell Cissy what the actor had told her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
about Harry Hawthorne. She could not bear to confess
her humiliation.</p>

<p>But she went with Standish to the park the next day,
and while skating on the lake a vision of beauty and grace
that attracted the eyes of admiring hundreds, she told him
that she had decided to go with the company on the road.</p>

<p>"Although Cissy is very angry with me, and vows that
I will repent it in dust and ashes," she added, uneasily.</p>

<p>"Don't listen to her croaking. She only envies your
good fortune," he returned, reassuringly. "Why, you will
soon be rich and famous, Miss Harding, for your beauty
and talent will win you rapid promotion on the boards.
Do you see how all those strangers have watched you on
the ice to-day? It is because your face has already won
you the sobriquet of 'the prettiest salesgirl in New York.'
Soon it will be changed to 'the prettiest actress on the
stage.' Will not that sound better?"</p>

<p>Harry Hawthorne remained in the Bellevue Hospital
ten days only, it having been discovered that his injuries
were not internal, as at first feared.</p>

<p>His temporary unconsciousness had resulted from the
severe cut on his head, and as this healed nicely, he grew
better, and asked for his discharge from the hospital. Indeed,
he would have recovered sooner but for a painful
suspense and anxiety that augmented fever and restlessness.</p>

<p>The young fireman had been so deeply smitten by the
charms of pretty Geraldine, that during his enforced confinement,
the thought of her had never been absent from
his mind. Love had sprung to life full grown within his
breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>When he was discharged from the hospital, he could not
wait until evening to call on her. The ready excuse of the
need of a pair of gloves took him to O'Neill's.</p>

<p>He did not wear his fireman's dress, but attired himself
in an elegant suit of clothes, such as gentlemen wear to
business. Thus arrayed, and looking as much the aristocrat
as any Fifth avenue millionaire, he entered the store and
went at once to the glove counter, his heart throbbing
wildly at thought of seeing Geraldine again, and making
an appointment to call on her that evening.</p>

<p>A whole row of smiling, pretty girls confronted him, but
among them all he could not see his heart's darling, the
lode-star of his dreams&mdash;sweet Geraldine.</p>

<p>He accosted the nearest girl&mdash;a plump, gray-eyed beauty&mdash;who
fortunately proved to be Miss Carroll.</p>

<p>"I wish to have Miss Harding show me some gloves. Is
she here?"</p>

<p>Cissy Carroll shook her dark head, and answered:</p>

<p>"Geraldine does not attend here any more. Can I show
you the gloves?"</p>

<p>"If you please," he replied, and as she placed them before
him, he took a pair, mechanically, in his shapely
hand, but continued:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, but has Miss Harding gone to another
store? She is a friend of mine. I wish to see her
very much."</p>

<p>"Your name?" asked Cissy, with a quick suspicion of
the truth, for he realized in his person Geraldine's description.</p>

<p>"I am Harry Hawthorne."</p>

<p>"I thought so. And I am Miss Carroll. Perhaps you have
heard Geraldine speak of me?"</p>

<p>He smiled, and answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, as her 'chum Cissy.' She told me, also, that you
roomed together."</p>

<p>"We did&mdash;but Geraldine has left me now."</p>

<p>She read the palpable disappointment on his face, and
added, quickly:</p>

<p>"She had a talent for acting, and has gone upon the
stage."</p>

<p>She saw him start as if she had struck him a blow in the
face, and he grew lividly pale, as he asked:</p>

<p>"At what theatre?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she has left New York, and gone on the road with
a stock company&mdash;the one that played 'Hearts and Homes'
two weeks here. You may remember Clifford Standish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the leading man. He procured the situation for Geraldine."</p>

<p>Then, as she saw from his face that he was taking it
quite hard, she added, with womanly curiosity:</p>

<p>"But how happens it that you are not acquainted with
these facts? The papers had some very flattering paragraphs
about the beautiful salesgirl who had left a New
York store to adopt a stage career."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;haven't read the papers," he murmured, faintly,
like one recovering from a blow.</p>

<p>"Oh, then you must have been away from New York&mdash;and
poor Geraldine expecting you to call every evening.
Why didn't you let her know?"</p>

<p>"I haven't been away from the city, Miss Carroll."</p>

<p>"Then why did you act toward her so shabbily?"</p>

<p>"Shabbily! Why I had a note written to her from the
hospital, explaining that an accident had overturned my
engine and seriously wounded me. I've been in Bellevue
Hospital ten days, Miss Carroll. Look," and he showed
her the scar on his head.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a wonder you were not killed," said the girl,
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"They thought I was at first, for I didn't recover consciousness
until the next day. Then, as soon as I could
think clearly at all, I thought of my broken engagement
of the evening before, and wondered what she would think
of me. I persuaded the nurse to write a little note for me,
as I was too shaky myself, and sent it by the messenger-boy
at the hospital. I hoped she would write me a line of
sympathy, and that&mdash;perhaps&mdash;she might even be sorry
enough to come and see me there. But I never received a
word!"</p>

<p>"She did not receive your note. Your failure to come
was a mystery to her always, Mr. Hawthorne."</p>

<p>"Why, that is very strange. I'll go back to the hospital
and see that messenger. But&mdash;will you give me her address
now?" eagerly. "I will write to her and explain."</p>

<p>Cissy blushed vividly, and said:</p>

<p>"I am sorry that I cannot, but the fact is I don't know
where she is, for&mdash;we parted in anger, vowing to have no
more to do with each other. I disliked Clifford Standish,
and tried to persuade her not to go on the stage. She went
in defiance of my advice&mdash;so she has not written to me."</p>

</div></div>


<p>Miss Carroll was sorry for the young fireman, as she
saw how pale and troubled his handsome face became at
her tidings.</p>

<p>She exclaimed, sympathetically:</p>

<p>"Maybe Geraldine will get over her anger and write to
me yet. She never stays angry long at a time. So, if she
writes, I'll let you know."</p>

<p>"Thank you, a hundred times over," gratefully, "and
may I call on you sometimes, to inquire?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Cissy, who liked him as much as
she had despised the actor. Almost every one has antipathies.
The actor was one of Cissy's, no doubt.</p>

<p>Harry Hawthorne thanked her for her courtesy, paid
for his gloves, and walked away with such a princely air
that all the pretty salesgirls followed his exit with admiring
eyes, and there was a swelling murmur of ejaculations:</p>

<p>"Oh, what a handsome fellow!"</p>

<p>"Isn't he perfectly magnif'?"</p>

<p>"Who is he, Cissy? A Fifth avenue millionaire?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed, girls; don't lose your wits! He's a
fireman at the Ludlow street engine-house, that's all."</p>

<p>"Oh, then he must be a prince in disguise; and, come to
think of it, millionaires are not usually good-looking, any
way. I might have known he was poor, from his beauty.
He was talking to you about Jerry Harding, wasn't he? Is
she his sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so. Don't bother me! I don't know," laughed
Cissy, cutting short their merry chatter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the object of their admiration hurried away
and returned to the hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>He had no trouble in finding the messenger-boy who
had taken his note to Geraldine, and the youth, unconscious
of having done wrong, very readily admitted that
he had given the note to a gentleman, who said he was
going in, and had offered to hand the letter to the lady.</p>

<p>"No harm done, I hope, sir?" he said, regretfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, more harm than you know. The man kept the letter,
so the young lady never received it. It was something
very important, too; and now she has gone away, and the
mischief you did can never be undone."</p>

<p>"Oh, my! what a pity!" exclaimed the boy, readily
guessing that here was a broken-off love affair. He looked
pityingly at Hawthorne a minute, then continued: "I'm
very sorry I made such a mistake. I thought the fellow
was a gentleman. But I know him, and I'll get even with
him for that trick&mdash;you see if I don't!"</p>

<p>"Who was he, Rob?"</p>

<p>"Why, that Standish that plays in 'Hearts and Homes.'
An elegant swell, don't you know? Gave me a quarter,
like a lord. But I'll hunt him up, and get back that
letter."</p>

<p>"You are too late, Rob. He has gone on the road with
his company."</p>

<p>"Whew! And the lady gone, too, with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a kettle of fish! Of my mixing, too! Indeed,
Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry; and, if I ever get a chance,
I'll do that fellow up for his treachery, the villain!" cried
the boy, so earnestly that the listener could but smile, for
he had no faith in the possibility of such an event taking
place.</p>

<p>He walked away, bitter at heart over the actor's
treachery.</p>

<p>"He kept that letter, and managed to make trouble between
us somehow, the cunning wretch!" he mused, sadly
enough, for the case looked hopeless now.</p>

<p>Standish, having gained such a signal advantage over
him in taking pretty Geraldine away, would follow it up
by wedding her before his return.</p>

<p>"If I could find out where she is on the road, I might
still write and explain all," he thought, with a gleam of
hope that quickly faded as he recalled the treacherous
nature of his rival.</p>

<p>"If I wrote to her, he would intercept my letter. He
will be on the watch for that. There is no use trying and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
hoping. I have lost her forever&mdash;bonny, brown-eyed Geraldine!"
he sighed, hopelessly.</p>

<p>As he returned to his work at the engine-house, he felt
as if he had just closed the coffin-lid over a well-beloved
face.</p>

<p>Such hopes and dreams as had come to him since he met
fair Geraldine were hard to relinquish; they had brought
such new brightness into his prosaic life; but he felt that
all was over now.</p>

<p>True, he felt that he had made a strong impression on
the girl's heart, but his rival would soon teach her to forget
that he had ever existed.</p>

<p>But in a few days hope began unconsciously to reassert
itself. He decided to call on Cecilia Carroll to inquire if
she had any news.</p>

<p>He went that evening, and she told him that Geraldine
had not written yet.</p>

<p>"But I found out from a manager the proposed route of
the company, and I have written to her, and told her
about you," she added, out of the kindness of her heart.</p>

<p>"Clifford Standish will take good care that she never receives
your letter," he said, bitterly, as he told her how
the actor had intercepted the note he had sent to Geraldine.</p>

<p>"I suspected as much, the grand villain!" cried Cissy,
indignantly. "So now I shall write to her again and expose
him!"</p>

<p>She did so, but no answer came to either of her letters.</p>

<p>Clifford Standish was too wily to permit Geraldine to
receive them. He easily got possession of her mail, and
destroyed it without a pang of remorse at his selfish heart.</p>

<span class="i1">It's easy to bear the worry and care<br /></span>
<span class="i3">If the old friends love us yet."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Yes, pretty Geraldine, piqued and unhappy over her
cruel disappointment in love, had joined the Clemens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Company, the manager of which was also one of the actors&mdash;Cameron
Clemens. He played the clever villain in
"Hearts and Homes," his special play, while Clifford
Standish took the hero's part.</p>

<p>Geraldine threw her whole heart into her work, and
succeeded so well that she was promoted in a week, owing
to the illness and withdrawal of the second lady from the
company. It was the part of an <i>ingenue</i>, which just suited
Geraldine's youth and <i>naivette</i>. She could act it to perfection
without laying aside her pretty naturalness of
manner.</p>

<p>They traveled from town to town, staying just a night
or two in each place, usually drawing full houses, and
Geraldine proved a great attraction, winning always so
much admiration that it was a wonder her pretty little
head was not turned by flattery.</p>

<p>It might have been had not her heart been so sore over
its brief, broken love-dream.</p>

<p>To have known a man but two brief, bright, happy days,
and not be able to forget him, it was absurd, she thought,
in desperate rebellion against her own heart.</p>

<p>And yet, through the busy weeks of travel, study, and
acting, Harry Hawthorne's image staid in her mind, and
his voice rang through her dreams, sweet and low and
tender as it had always been to her whenever he spoke.</p>

<p>In her waking hours she knew him light and false; in
her dreams he was always tender and true, and inexpressibly
dear.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Last night in my deep sleep I dreamed of you&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Again the old love woke in me and thrived<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On looks of fire, on kisses, and sweet words<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like silver waters purling in a stream&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i10">A dream&mdash;a dream!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Through all the changing days in which the silent struggle
against a hopeless love went on in her young heart,
Clifford Standish was ever near, patient, tender, devoted,
telling her with his yearning eyes the love she was not
ready to listen to yet.</p>

<p>And in spite of herself, Geraldine found a subtle comfort
in his devotion.</p>

<p>It was a balm of healing to her proud heart, so deeply
wounded by Harry Hawthorne's trifling.</p>

<p>Many hearts have been caught in the rebound in this
fashion, many true loves won.</p>

<p>True, there are many proud ones who do not prize a love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
they can only have because it has been scornfully refused
by another.</p>

<p>They will say, resentfully:</p>

<p>"I will not accept a love that is given me only because
it was left by one who did not prize it."</p>

<p>Others, more humble, will gladly accept the grateful
love of a wounded heart that finds consolation in their tenderness.</p>

<p>Clifford Standish, madly in love with Geraldine, was
glad to accept such crumbs of love as might fall to him
from the royal feast that had been spread for Harry Hawthorne.</p>

<p>So he hovered by her side, he paid her the most delicate
attentions, anticipating every wish, and found ample reward
as he saw himself gaining in her grateful regard.</p>

<p>At the same time the arch-traitor was intercepting the
few letters that came to her, and the ones she wrote to
Miss Carroll.</p>

<p>For Geraldine had long ago gotten over her pet with
her friend, since she know in her heart how dear she was
to Cissy, and that the girl had advised her for her own
good.</p>

<p>Geraldine had found out that the career of an actress&mdash;even
a young, pretty, and popular one&mdash;is not always
strewn with roses.</p>

<p>She had to study hard, and she did not enjoy traveling
all day, or even half a day, and then appearing on the
boards at night. Sometimes the hotel accommodations of
country towns where they stopped over were wretchedly
indifferent. Sometimes her head ached miserably, but she
must appear on the boards, all the same. And the free-and-easy
ways of some of the company did not please the
fastidious taste of the girl.</p>

<p>Now and then she found her thoughts returning to the
old days behind the counter at O'Neill's with Cissy and
the other girls, with an almost pathetic yearning. Secretly
she longed to be back again.</p>

<p>How she wished that Cissy would write to her now, and
beg her to return, so that she might have an excuse for
following the dictates of her heart.</p>

<p>At last, believing that Cissy was too proud and stubborn
to write first, she penned her a long, affectionate letter,
through which breathed an underline of repentance and
regret that her chum would be sure to answer it by
writing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come home, dear. I told you that you would get sick
of being an actress."</p>

<p>But Geraldine was too weary and heart-sick to care for
a hundred "I-told-you-so's" from the triumphant Cissy.
What did it matter so that she got back to her dear old
chum again and their cozy little rooms, and even to what
she had once called her slavery behind the counter.</p>

<p>She recalled what Harry Hawthorne had told her about
it being a slavery of the stage, too; then put the thought
from her with an impatient sigh.</p>

<p>"What do I care what he said about it?" indignantly,
then sighing, "even though I have found it to be, alas, too
true!"</p>

<p>She wrote her letter to Cissy, and after that her heart
felt lighter. She knew her chum would be glad to get the
letter&mdash;glad to have her back.</p>

<p>Poor Geraldine! what a hopeless waiting she had for the
letter that never came!</p>

<p>How could he bear the wistful light in her sad brown
eyes, the wretch who had robbed her young life of happiness?</p>

<p>In his keeping rested the letters of the two fond girls to
each other&mdash;the letters that would have brought happiness
to three sad hearts.</p>

<p>And the weeks slipped into months while they echoed in
their souls the poet's plaint:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The solemn Sea of Silence lies between us;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I know thou livest and thou lovest me;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And yet I wish some white ship would come sailing<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Across the ocean bearing news of thee.<br /></span>

<span class="i3">And interrupt its utterance with a word."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was two months now since they had gone upon the
road, but not a word had Geraldine received. It seemed to
her as if the past days were a dream, so different was her
life now&mdash;all whirl, confusion, and excitement.</p>

<p>Once she had thought this would be charming. Now she
found it the reverse.</p>

<p>How glad she was to hear that the company would go
back to New York in time for Christmas. She was so tired
of the West, where they had been all these weeks.</p>

<p>When they were on their homeward way, they stopped
over for a night at a pretty West Virginia town a few
hundred miles from New York.</p>

<p>They had come straight through from Chicago, and the
stop-over was very agreeable to the weary members of the
company.</p>

<p>They arrived in the afternoon, and the tired travelers,
after resting a while at their romantic hotel on the banks
of the beautiful Greenbrier River, set out to explore the
little town of Alderson, first hurrying to the post-office for
their letters, which they expected to be awaiting them
there.</p>

<p>Geraldine did not expect any mail, poor girl! She waited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
at the door while Clifford Standish went in and came out
with a little budget for himself.</p>

<p>"Nothing for you, Geraldine. It seems that Miss Carroll
is still unforgiving," he laughed, without noting the sensitive
quiver of her scarlet lips.</p>

<p>They walked on, and she pretended to be absorbed in
contemplation of the beautiful mountain scenery, while he
ran over his letters.</p>

<p>"Let us cross the railroad and walk on the bridge over
there," she said, at last.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful sunny day, very calm and mild for
December. They loitered on the broad bridge that spanned
the romantic river between the two towns, Alderson and
North Alderson, and while she watched the lapsing river
and the mountain peaks against the clear blue sky, he read
to her bits of his letters from New York.</p>

<p>"Here's one that will interest you," he laughed, meaningly,
and read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Well, old fellow, there's nothing that I know in the
way of interesting news just now, unless that a girl you
used to be sweet on is going to be married to-morrow. It's
little Daisy Odell, you know, of Newburgh. She's been
visiting a married sister here, and caught a beau. He's a
fireman named Harry Hawthorne, a big, handsome fellow,
the hero of several fires. The marriage will take place at
Mrs. Stansbury's, and I've an invitation to it.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>He looked from the letter to her face, and saw that she
was deadly pale and grief-stricken.</p>

<p>"Oh, will you let me read that for myself?" she gasped,
as if she could scarcely believe him.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," he answered, but as he was handing
her the crumpled sheet, the wind caught it somehow, and
fluttered it beyond reach over the rail and down into the
river.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! oh!" he cried, with pretended dismay, but his
outstretched hand could not grasp it.</p>

<p>"It's gone; but no matter&mdash;the news must be true, for
Charlie Butler wrote it, and he always tells the truth,"
he said, carelessly.</p>

<p>And how was the unsuspecting girl to know that no
such words were written in the letter, and that it was
from a woman, instead of Charlie Butler?</p>

</div></div>


<p>Geraldine was proud, very proud&mdash;and she thought she
had quite overcome her hopeless love for Harry Hawthorne.</p>

<p>But the sudden, unexpected news of his marriage, that
she never thought of doubting, struck her with the suddenness
of an awful blow, beating down pride and reserve
at one terrible stroke.</p>

<p>She realized all at once that her heart had still kept
alive a little fire of hope burning before the shrine of its
unacknowledged love. The quenching of this spark of hope
was almost like the going out of life itself.</p>

<p>The other members of the party had gone on to the
other side of the bridge and she was alone with Clifford
Standish&mdash;alone with the agony of soul that blanched her
sweet face to death-like pallor, and made her clutch at the
rails, gasping out that she was ill, dying.</p>

<p>The arch-villain caught her swaying form and held it
tenderly in his arms, while her white, unconscious face
rested against his shoulder.</p>

<p>Some country people walking over the bridge at that
moment stared in amazement, and going on to town, reported
that, "those actor-folks were carrying on dreadful
on the bridge&mdash;hugging right before folks."</p>

<p>But neither of the two participants was troubled over
this sensation, Geraldine being unconscious, and Standish
too much absorbed in her to heed aught else.</p>

<p>In a minute or two she sighed and opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, as she met his eyes gazing deep into
hers, and tried to struggle from his clasp.</p>

<p>"Wait. You cannot stand alone yet," he said, tenderly,
then murmured: "Oh, Geraldine, it breaks my heart to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
find that you loved him, that low fireman, so unworthy
of you; while I&mdash;I&mdash;have worshiped you ever since the
hour I first saw you behind the counter, so bright and
beautiful. I have been trying to win you ever since, and
hoped&mdash;vainly hoped, as I see now&mdash;that I was succeeding.
Oh, how did he succeed&mdash;this man you saw but a few
hours&mdash;in winning your love?"</p>

<p>She struggled from his clasp, her strength returning,
her face hot with blushes of fierce shame.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it&mdash;is not true that I love him&mdash;no, no, no!" she
faltered, wildly.</p>

<p>"But, my dearest girl, you fainted when you heard of
his marriage."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it was not that. I was tired, ill&mdash;from traveling,
you know," cried poor Geraldine, who would have
died rather than admit the truth which her pale, pale
cheeks and trembling lips told all too plainly by their
mute despair.</p>

<p>But her denial suited the actor's purpose, and he cried,
gladly:</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so happy to hear you say you did not care
for him. I feared&mdash;feared&mdash;that your kindness to me,
your sweet smiles and ready acceptance of my attentions
were only cruel coquetry."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," she murmured, helplessly, feeling herself
drawn to him by every word he said.</p>

<p>Had she given him cause, then, to believe she meant to
accept him?</p>

<p>He caught her hand, and continued, fondly, eagerly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Geraldine, dare I hope you care for me after all?
That you will let me love you, and you love me a little in
return? Will you&mdash;be my wife?"</p>

<p>He saw her shudder as with a mortal chill; then pride
came to her aid. She let him keep the hand he had taken,
and she answered, faintly:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>And then a great horror of what she had promised
rushed over her. How could she be his wife when she did
not love him? Such a marriage would be sacrilege!</p>

<p>Her head drooped heavily, and her eyes were half-closed
as she listened despairingly to the words of grateful joy
he poured out. Not one of them found an echo in her
heart.</p>

<p>Until now she had been grateful to him for his kindness,
but a sudden aversion took root in her heart now, and she
felt that she would rather die than be his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>But, to save her life, she could not have opened her lips
to take back her promise.</p>

<p>She knew how angry he would be, how he would accuse
her of trifling and coquetry. She could not bring down on
herself the weight of his wrath.</p>

<p>But to the day of her death Geraldine would never forget
that hour on the bridge at Alderson&mdash;that hour into
whose short compass were crowded so much pain and regret
that she longed for death to end her misery.</p>

<p>Mechanically she heard the whistle of an approaching
train coming over the track at the end of the bridge. The
rumble and roar blent with the rush of the river in her
ears as she said, wearily:</p>

<p>"Let us return to the hotel. I&mdash;am&mdash;so&mdash;tired!"</p>

<p>Alas, poor girl! it was a tired heart!</p>

<p>They walked back toward the railroad, and the train
came rushing on with a thunderous roar.</p>

<p>There was not one thought of suicide in her mind&mdash;she
had always thought it a weak and cowardly act&mdash;but
somehow a mad longing for death&mdash;because life was so
bitter&mdash;seized on unhappy Geraldine.</p>

<p>The train was so close that they must wait for it to pass
before they could cross.</p>

<p>She darted suddenly from the side of Standish and threw
herself face downward across the trembling rails.</p>

<p>Harry Hawthorne called on Miss Carroll several times,
but she always had the same discouraging story to tell&mdash;no
answer from Geraldine to the letters she had written.</p>

<p>He gave up going at last, and tried to resign himself to
his cruel disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"If she ever cared for me in the least, that villain
Standish with his infernal arts, has turned her against me
forever. But let him look out for himself if he ever returns
to New York. We shall have a reckoning then,
over my letter to Geraldine that he intercepted," he
said to himself, bitterly and often.</p>

<p>Those were dreary days to the young fireman after he
came out of the hospital and found Geraldine gone. People
had always called him cold and unsocial somehow, and
he became more reticent than ever now, going nowhere at
all except when Captain Stansbury fairly dragged him to
the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stansbury, as soon as she returned from Newburgh,
had been anxious to renew her acquaintance with
Geraldine, but meeting Standish on the street one day and
asking after her, she was told that the young girl had lost
her position at O'Neill's because of her trip to Newburgh
and had gone back to her country home in consequence.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so sorry, for I wished to cultivate her acquaintance,
she was such a lovely girl!" the good-natured
young woman said, regretfully:</p>

<p>"Yes, very pretty, but a shocking flirt! I got acquainted
with her on the street by a handkerchief flirtation,"
laughed the actor, and he saw that the leaven worked.
Mrs. Stansbury did not approve of forward girls, and her
eagerness to see more of pretty Geraldine was at once
abated.</p>

<p>She knew no better until weeks later, when her husband
brought Hawthorne home for dinner, and discussing the
pleasant times they had had at Newburgh, he told her of
Geraldine's going on the stage with Standish.</p>

<p>Little by little all came out, and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Mr. Standish must have lied to me in saying that she
had lost her place and gone home to the country, and that
he made her acquaintance by a street flirtation."</p>

<p>"It was cruelly false," answered Hawthorne, who had
heard from Cissy the whole story of the beginning of the
acquaintance of the wily actor and the pretty shop-girl.
He continued:</p>

<p>"He wished to prevent your further association with
Geraldine, so as to keep her away from me."</p>

<p>"And he really intercepted your letter to her? I did not
dream he was such a villain."</p>

<p>"He shall answer to me for that injury when we meet
again," he said, so sternly that she saw that he was in bitter
earnest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>She admired him for his manly resentment, and said,
cordially:</p>

<p>"I do not blame you for wishing to punish him. Any
manly man would do likewise. As for Geraldine, when she
learns of his perfidy, she will turn from him in disgust."</p>

<p>"Unless she has learned to love the villain. Women are
so faithful in their love even when the object is unworthy,"
he sighed.</p>

<p>Changing the subject, she continued:</p>

<p>"Do you know that Sister Daisy is to be married the
week before Christmas?"</p>

<p>"Your husband told me."</p>

<p>"Yes? Well, the bridal party are to spend Christmas with
me. The other girls&mdash;Carrie and Consuelo&mdash;are coming,
too. I intend to have a theatre party on Christmas Eve&mdash;a
box to ourselves&mdash;and I want you to join us, won't you?
And bring some pretty girl with you, for my sisters will
have their beaus."</p>

<p>"I don't know any girl," he began, then suddenly remembered
pretty Cissy Carroll.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'll join the party if I can get leave. And
there's a girl I know&mdash;Miss Carroll&mdash;the very intimate
friend of pretty Geraldine. I'll bring her, if she will accept
an invitation."</p>

<p>"Very well, and you may take me to call on her in the
meanwhile, and then I can ask her to the dance I'm going
to give the girls," replied amiable Mrs. Stansbury.</p>

<p>And so it was arranged that Cissy made the acquaintance
of the Stansbury clique, and fell in love with them as
deeply as Geraldine had done.</p>

<p>And on Christmas Eve they all filled a box at the theatre&mdash;and
a merry party they were, for even Harry Hawthorne
unbent from the grave reserve that was habitual to him of
late, and tried to make himself entertaining to gentle
Cissy while the orchestra played and they waited for the
first act.</p>

<p>"What is the play?" asked Hawthorne, for Captain
Stansbury had secured the tickets, and reserved the name
of the piece as a surprise to the party.</p>

<p>"It's 'Laurel Vane'&mdash;a society play, by a well-known
author&mdash;and it is to be presented for the first time to-night,"
replied Captain Stansbury.</p>

<p>"I hope it is a good company," said his wife.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;excellent. The Clemens Company. I know the
manager well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a start from all, and Mrs. Stansbury said,
nervously:</p>

<p>"But I thought that company was on the road."</p>

<p>"They returned to New York yesterday, with this new
play," replied the captain, who was not in the secret of
Clifford Standish's villainy.</p>

<p>The orchestra stopped playing, and the curtain rose.</p>

</p>


<p>Poor, pretty Geraldine, if she had ever thought of
death at all, she had never dreamed of ending her life like
this beneath the wheels of this great panting, shrieking
iron monster, rushing down upon her as her beautiful
form lay across the bright steel rails where she had
thrown herself in the extremity of despair!</p>

<p>But, frantic with hopeless love and terror at the promise
she had just given&mdash;the reckless promise of her hand without
the heart&mdash;reason had momentarily deserted its
throne, and, conscious only of a mad desire to escape from
life's tragedies of woe, she rushed forward in front of the
train, and laid her golden head down upon the pillow of
death, like one lying down to pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>And although her suicidal act was seen by fifty pairs of
eyes, it was too late for even the most heroic hand to
snatch her from her impending doom.</p>

<p>The locomotive was so close upon her the moment she
fell before it that the immense cow-catcher touched her,
and&mdash;even as the horrified shriek of Standish rang upon
the wintry air&mdash;it seemed to draw her beneath the horrible
grinding machine!</p>

<p>Did Heaven, in pity and mercy, intervene to save the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
rash girl from the consequences of her mad attempt at
self-destruction?</p>

<p>Not once in a hundred cases is a human life saved by
being caught and thrown upward by the projecting cow-catcher
in front of the monster locomotive.</p>

<p>Yet once in a while such a fortunate intervention occurs,
and a fatal disaster is prevented.</p>

<p>To poor, reckless Geraldine, who had placed herself beyond
the reach of human aid, this accident happened, or
our story must have ended here with the tragic close of
her short life.</p>

<p>It almost seemed as if invisible angels must have caught
up her doomed form from the track and placed it on the
great shovel-like projection in safety, so miraculous
seemed the saving of her life.</p>

<p>And a moment later the train, which had been slowing
up as it entered the town, came to a full stop at the station,
and the horrified engineer, who had been utterly unable
to prevent what had seemed to happen, saw Geraldine's
form lying on the platform of the cow-catcher, where
it had rebounded at the first touch, and a cry of thanksgiving
rose from his throat, echoed by a hundred other
voices of those who had seen it all, and who now rushed
to the spot in wild haste.</p>

<p>Quiet little Alderson had a sensation that day never to
be forgotten in after years, when the express train rushed
into the station bearing on its very front that form of a
beautiful girl driven wild by sorrow, until she had tried to
end her life in this terrible fashion.</p>

<p>What kind and eager hands drew her from her perilous
position; what sympathetic eyes gazed on her beautiful
white face as they laid her down on the platform, quite
unconscious, for she had swooned when she threw herself
on the track.</p>

<p>Every doctor in town was speedily on the scene. They
vied with each other in their efforts to restore her to consciousness.</p>

<p>And in a few minutes Geraldine opened her heavy-lidded
eyes with a blank gaze, and saw herself surrounded by a
sympathetic, though curious crowd, and, as in a dream,
heard Clifford Standish eagerly explaining to the people:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed; you are mistaken. It was not an attempt
at suicide; it was only a fool-hardy attempt to cross
the track before the engine. She declared that she could
do it safely, and dared me to follow her, darting from my
side before I could restrain her, for I would not have permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the rash venture otherwise. Still, I believe she
would have accomplished the feat and cleared the track by
a hair's breadth, only that her foot slipped and threw her
down at that fatal moment."</p>

<p>Bending down to Geraldine's ear, he whispered, warningly:</p>

<p>"Do not contradict what I have told them, or they may
put you in prison for attempted suicide, as they do in New
York."</p>

<p>The people thought he was her lover, whispering to her
of his joy at her safety, and in a moment he confirmed the
belief by saying aloud:</p>

<p>"She would be distressed if any one accused her of trying
to kill herself, for she is one of the happiest girls in
the world. In fact, while we were standing on the bridge
she had promised to marry me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I say him hugging her on the bridge, myself,"
said the old countryman who had passed them, and a smile
went around, and then a cheer for the fair young life
saved for a happy wedded future.</p>

<p>They carried her to the hotel that was but a few yards
away, and it was found that she had sustained some
bruises on her side, that was all. She would be able to go
on with the company.</p>

<p>And a great revulsion of feeling took place in her mind&mdash;joy
that her life was spared, horror at the momentary
insanity that had driven her to that awful deed. Life
grew sweet again, in spite of her great sorrow.</p>

<p>When the sympathetic women left her alone that evening
in her room, she knelt down in a passion of repentance,
and prayed God to forgive her for her great sin
in trying to throw away the life He had given.</p>

<p>And she prayed Heaven to help her to forget Harry
Hawthorne, and to love Clifford Standish, the man she
had promised to marry.</p>

<p>"Surely he is good and true, and deserves my love,"
she thought, in an impulse of gratitude to him for the way
he had shielded her when the people talked of suicide. She
was ashamed of the truth now&mdash;glad for them to think it
had been an accident.</p>

<p>"I will never be so foolish and so wicked again," she
thought, in her keen remorse for her sin.</p>

<p>She spent a wakeful, restless night in spite of the sedatives
the kind Doctor Spicer had administered before he
went away. The hotel was so close to the railroad that she
could hear the trains thundering by all night long, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
sound made her shudder with terror at thought of the
heavy iron wheels that had come so near to crushing out
her fair young life.</p>

<p>She was glad when morning came, and they boarded the
train for New York.</p>

<p>She was eager to get away from this place, yet she
would never forget Alderson, with its beautiful mountains,
its romantic, winding river, and the bridge where
she had stood with Standish, listening to the cruel words
that had extinguished the last spark of hope in her breast
and driven her mad with despair.</p>

<p>No, she would never forget beautiful Alderson, on the
rippling, winding, singing Greenbrier River, set like an
emerald chain between its romantic banks, overshadowed
by wooded mountains, but she would remember it always
with a horror it did not deserve, poor Geraldine, because
of its tragic associations.</p>

<p>We must return to our description of the scene in the
theatre when the curtain rose on the first act, and the
eager eyes of the large audience turned upon the stage.</p>

<p>The heroine of the play, Laurel Vane, a beautiful girl,
left penniless and alone by the death of her only surviving
parent, was discovered weeping in the shabby room
from which she would soon be turned out, because she
had no money to pay her rent.</p>

<p>Enter the handsome villain, Ross Powell, who declares
his love for Laurel, and makes wicked proposals.</p>

<p>Repulsed with scorn, he departs, vowing vengeance on
the scornful little beauty.</p>

<p>Desperate with misery, Laurel seeks a beautiful young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
lady, the noble daughter of a publisher, for whose magazine
her father had written until his death.</p>

<p>"She is a sister-woman, and will help me in my trouble,"
thought the poor girl.</p>

<p>Between this splendid Miss Gordon and her clever maid,
a plan was formed by which the orphan girl (by sailing
under false colors) became the honored guest of wealthy
people, and afterward the bride of a proud aristocrat, who
thought he had married the peerless Miss Gordon, and had
never heard of poor little Laurel Vane, who was his worshiped
wife.</p>

<p>Upon this conspiracy hung all the plot of the play, and
the leading parts were taken, first by Clifford Standish,
leading man, the part of the hero, St. Leon Le Roy; the
part of the heroine, Laurel Vane, by Geraldine Harding;
the villain, Ross Powell, by Cameron Clemens; and Miss
Gordon by Madeline Mills, the usual star of the company,
although she had yielded precedence in this case to Geraldine,
who looked so exactly the part of the <i>ingenue</i>
heroine, with her starry brown eyes and curly golden
hair.</p>

<p>But it is not necessary to our story to go into the details
of the play. Although it enthralled the attention of the
sympathetic audience, it held even greater interest for the
party in the Stansbury box, because they knew two of the
actors so well.</p>

<p>How it thrilled Harry Hawthorne to see pretty Geraldine
again, even though he deprecated her stage career so
bitterly.</p>

<p>As for Cissy, the tears sprang to her eyes when she first
saw her lost friend, looking so familiar in the same simple
black serge gown she had worn behind the counter when
she was only a salesgirl at O'Neill's great store, and which
answered excellently well for the mourning gown of the
orphan heroine. Indeed, that floating mass of golden locks
was glory enough to lend beauty to the shabbiest attire.</p>

<p>They watched her with absorbing interest through the
changes of the play, but for a long time Geraldine did not
perceive them. She was absorbed in her work, and did
not cast coquettish glances at the boxes, like the other
actresses. It was well she did not, for the sight of them
would have unnerved her cruelly.</p>

<p>But Clifford Standish was on the alert, and while posing
as the magnificent Le Roy, scowled secretly at the occupants
of that particular box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>When the first act was over, he intercepted Geraldine
on her way to the dressing-room, and said:</p>

<p>"I have something very particular to tell you.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Now call your pride to your aid, dear one, for you will
be shocked, I know. But I thought it best to put you on
your guard."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, paling suddenly, but with her
small head proudly erect.</p>

<p>"Have you noticed the first box to the right?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not looked at the house at all. I heard it
was crowded," wearily.</p>

<p>"It is, and we have made a hit. But&mdash;that box&mdash;there's
a theatre party in it&mdash;all people that you know."</p>

<p>"Indeed," listlessly, pretending no interest.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I tell you about them now so you will not notice
them when you go on again in the second part. They
are the Stansburys; the bride and groom, Harry and Mrs.
Hawthorne; the two single Odell girls, and Cissy Carroll,
with three young men&mdash;their beaus, no doubt."</p>

<p>She clutched his arm with a trembling hand.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;wish you had not told me," she faltered. "I&mdash;shall&mdash;be
nervous now&mdash;in my part, I fear."</p>

<p>"You do not mean that you can care for that fellow still&mdash;you,
my promised bride, and he the husband of Daisy
Odell?" reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no; do not accuse me of such weakness,"
wildly. "But there is&mdash;Cissy, you know&mdash;Cissy turned
against me, and we were so fond once!"</p>

<p>Her voice was almost a wail.</p>

<p>"Do not think of her, my dearest love&mdash;she is not
worthy of it, the jealous, envious creature! Call pride to
help you appear indifferent. Do not even turn your head
toward that box, and they need never know how they
have wounded your fond heart," he persisted, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I will obey you," she answered, faintly.</p>

<p>"And, Geraldine, my darling&mdash;my sweet, promised bride&mdash;you
know how madly I love you, but you have denied
all my prayers for an immediate marriage! Will you not
relent and make me the happiest man on earth? Oh, let us
be married to-night after the play! It can be managed
easily enough. Say yes, dearest?"</p>

<p>A call-boy came through the corridor, chanting:</p>

<p>"Only five minutes till next act&mdash;only five minutes."</p>

<p>She broke away from him, panting, breathlessly:</p>

<p>"I cannot answer you now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>She fled to her dressing-room, glad to escape his importunities,
yet feeling as if she did not do him justice by her
lack of love.</p>

<p>"He is so patient, so tender, and so eager to spare me
pain, that I ought to love him more than I do," she told
herself.</p>

<p>Respect and esteem she could give him, for she believed
that he was good and noble, so well had he acted the
traitor's part; but love&mdash;oh, we cannot give love at will!</p>

<span class="i3">I have no heart for thee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She stole to the wings one moment, to gaze by stealth
at the theatre party, and by the merest accident Harry
Hawthorne was leaning over the bride's chair, talking to
her of some trifle, but the sight made Geraldine draw back
all white and quivering, with a cruel pang at her heart.</p>

<p>"I hate him!" she moaned, to herself, in a passion of
jealous despair.</p>

<p>But when she came upon the stage she did not look
again at the box, or she would have seen that Harry Hawthorne
sat apart from Daisy, by the side of Cissy. She
acted her part well, for in it there was much of the tragic
pain that suited well with her desperate mood.</p>

<p>At the close of the second act, Standish renewed his
pleadings for a marriage that night, and in her bitter
mood, Geraldine, like many others who exchange one pain
for another in mad impatience, ceased to struggle against
his importunities and yielded a passive consent to his ardent
prayer.</p>

<span class="i0">"A love like ours was a challenge to fate;<br /></span>

<p>Yes, she had promised to marry Clifford Standish as
soon as the last act of the play was over. The act would
leave the heroine, Laurel, presumably "happy ever after"
but must plunge poor Geraldine into deeper despair.</p>

<p>For though she admired Clifford Standish greatly, was
proud of his love, and grateful for his kindness, she did
not feel as if she could ever love him as she had loved another.
Her poor heart seemed dead and cold in its numb
misery of slighted love, and the thought of marriage was
repugnant to every instinct of her nature.</p>

<p>But she owed Clifford Standish such a debt of gratitude
that there seemed no way of paying it save by yielding to
his importunate entreaties for an immediate marriage.</p>

<p>But how she shrank from the moment that would seal
her fate, although she had failed in courage to defend herself
from it.</p>

<p>It was a bitter pride that was pushing her into this unloving
marriage.</p>

<p>She would let Harry Hawthorne, who had flirted with
her so cruelly, see that she did not care for him at all;
that she could marry a man who was his superior in position,
in riches, and in everything that made up true and
noble manhood.</p>

<p>Geraldine despised a male flirt. Whenever one of the
creatures tried to catch her eyes in public, she always set
him down beneath contempt, and one withering glance
from her flashing eyes would make him shrink into himself,
ashamed for once before the scornful eyes of a true
woman.</p>

<p>And the thought that Harry Hawthorne was one of
those contemptible wretches was inexpressibly bitter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>She had shed many secret tears over the dread that he
had read in her frank brown eyes the tenderness he had
awakened in her heart.</p>

<p>She thought when she was married to the actor, and
Hawthorne heard of it, he would think she had only been
flirting with him at Newburgh, and that she had been engaged
to Standish all the while. In this fancy there was a
kind of balm for her aching heart.</p>

<p>She could hardly keep the tears back from her eyes as
she thought it over and over, wondering if, after all,
Harry Hawthorne had not cared for her a wee bit, but had
been bound to Daisy Odell beforehand.</p>

<p>She wondered if she should ever meet him again, after
she was married, and if it would give him pain to know if
she belonged to another man.</p>

<p>To save her life, Geraldine could not help half-believing
in the ardent love that had looked at her out of those
dark-blue eyes, and if she would but have looked up at the
box where he sat, she would have seen that love shining
on her still&mdash;a love as strong as death, although it was so
hopeless.</p>

<p>But Geraldine did not look that way, tutored to proud
indifference by the cunning arts of Standish. She seemed
cold as ice, but her heart was burning with restless longings
for her lost love-dream.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he may repent and love me some day when it
is too late&mdash;too late!" she sighed, bitterly, thinking of the
sweet</p>

</div></div>

<p>Poor Geraldine wished that the hands of time could turn
back and delay the moment of her marriage, now so speedily
approaching.</p>

<p>But the second act was over, the third and last began.</p>

<p>She was so nervous, it was the greatest wonder in the
world that she did not forget her lines, and call down the
ridicule of the audience. But she threw herself with
abandon into the part. It was so tragic she could feel every
word of it.</p>

<p>And so the end came.</p>

<p>It was the moment before the curtain fell, when the
whole company were grouped upon the stage in the final
tableau, that&mdash;a startling interruption occurred.</p>

<p>A deputy sheriff, with his aids, strode upon the stage,
and clapped his hand on the shoulder of Clifford Standish.</p>

<p>"You are my prisoner!" he said, sternly; and added: "I
have a warrant for your arrest for deserting your wife."</p>

<p>It was like a thunder-clap, so sudden and so startling.</p>

<p>The actor, at that moment, was holding Geraldine's
hand in a fervent clasp, and he felt it turn cold as ice as
she drew it from him in trembling horror.</p>

<p>He grew lividly pale beneath his stage make-up, but he
tried to brazen it out by saying:</p>

<p>"Officer, you have made a mistake. I am not the man."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you are, Clifford Standish, and you must come
with me to the Tombs at once," returned the deputy
sheriff, with a satirical smile.</p>

<p>"I tell you it is a mistake; I have no wife, and this is a
base attempt to injure an innocent man. I will prove it in
court to-morrow," exclaimed the actor, putting on an air
of injured innocence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>The audience was in an uproar, cries of sympathy and
jeers of execration blending together. The accusation of
the deputy sheriff had been heard by all. Mrs. Stansbury's
box party looked and listened with breathless interest, and
Cissy whispered to Hawthorne.</p>

<p>"Oh, the grand villain! trying to brazen it out! but I
am sure that he is guilty. And poor Geraldine, how white
and stricken she looks. I'm going down to her to persuade
her to come home with me to-night."</p>

<p>"You must come with me," repeated the deputy sheriff,
sternly, to Standish, and he answered, sullenly:</p>

<p>"Very well; but first let me speak to Miss Harding."</p>

<p>And while they guarded him closely, he whispered to
the dazed and shrinking girl:</p>

<p>"For God's sake, do not believe the falsehood that has
been trumped up against me by some enemy just to injure
me in your regards. It is not true, and if you will only
believe in me till to-morrow, I will prove it."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;will try to trust in you," she faltered, gently,
but in her heart she knew that she was glad of this interruption
to her wedding&mdash;knew that she hoped the charge
was true.</p>

<p>If he had a wife already, he would be proved a villain,
and she&mdash;Geraldine&mdash;would be free of the promise so
rashly made.</p>

<p>"One more promise, my angel! Do not have anything
to say to&mdash;to&mdash;my enemies in the box. They will try to
turn your heart against me," he pleaded, feverishly.</p>

<p>"Come, come! I cannot wait any longer," the deputy
sheriff said, roughly, and pulled him away before she
could reply.</p>

<p>And the next moment Cissy's soft hand clasped hers,
and her gentle voice said:</p>

<p>"Let us be friends again, dear Geraldine."</p>

<p>"Oh, Cissy, darling," and the pretty actress, whom all
had been praising for her genius, fell into the other's
arms, sobbing like a weary child.</p>

<p>"You poor, dear child!" cooed Cissy, patting the golden
head. Then&mdash;"You'll come home with me for to-night,
dear, won't you? I have a cab waiting."</p>

<p>Geraldine was only too glad to go. She hurried her
friend to the dressing-room to wait while she got ready.</p>

<p>Cissy chatted incessantly:</p>

<p>"You didn't see us all, so grand in that box to-night,
did you? I tried to catch your eye, but you never looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
once! And poor Harry Hawthorne, how disappointed he
was at your indifference!"</p>

<p>"Cissy!" and the pretty actress stamped her tiny foot
angrily.</p>

<p>"Good gracious! What is the matter, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Never mention that man to me again! I hate him!"</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;Clifford Standish? I don't blame you! I've hated
him ever since he first became known to me."</p>

<p>"No, no; I mean Harry Hawthorne!"</p>

<p>"Why, what has he done to you, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"Has&mdash;hasn't he&mdash;gone and married Daisy Odell?"
with a stifled sob.</p>

<p>Cissy Carroll made big eyes of surprise at Geraldine's
charge.</p>

<p>"Married Daisy Odell? Harry Hawthorne? Why, certainly
not! Whatever put such an idea into your dear
little noddle?" she demanded, in wonder.</p>

<p>"Mr. Standish told me so before we came back to New
York. He said he had an invitation to the wedding. And
isn't Daisy married to him, after all? Oh, Cissy, don't try
to deceive me, for I saw her&mdash;saw her in the box all in
white&mdash;so bride-like&mdash;and Harry Hawthorne leaning over
her chair," exclaimed Geraldine, clutching the other's
arm with unconscious violence, her beautiful eyes dilated
with doubt and entreaty.</p>

<p>"My darling Gerry, don't pinch me black and blue,
please, and don't get so excited. Yes, Daisy Odell is certainly
married."</p>

<p>"Oh-h-h!" groaned Geraldine, in anguish.</p>

<p>"She is married," pursued Cissy, "and married to one
of the dearest fellows in the world, she says&mdash;Charlie Butler&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
not to Harry Hawthorne. Why, I don't believe
he wants to marry any one in the world but you!"</p>

<p>"Me&mdash;Cissy!" and Geraldine's face, so lugubrious a moment
before, grew radiant with joy, while the girl continued:</p>

<p>"That wretch, Clifford Standish, has told you falsehoods
about Mr. Hawthorne, dear, for he never thought
of loving any one but you. Didn't you see him with me in
the box to-night? I am the only girl he ever goes with, and
that is just for your sake, dear, because I was your
friend."</p>

<p>"Oh, Cissy!"</p>

<p>Such joy as there was in those two words, for new life
came to Geraldine in the assurance that Hawthorne was
free, and loved her still.</p>

<p>She put on her dress with trembling fingers, crying:</p>

<p>"Oh, help me, Cissy, I'm so nervous&mdash;and&mdash;and tired,
you know."</p>

<p>"Poor child! no wonder. And troubled, too, perhaps, for
maybe you&mdash;loved that Standish!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no&mdash;never, Cissy!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad, for that would have broken poor Hawthorne's
tender heart, he loves you so much. And you,
dear&mdash;didn't you care for him a little, too?"</p>

<p>Geraldine was all blushing, blissful confusion.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;you know how that was, Cissy. I liked him&mdash;just
a little&mdash;at first, but when he did not come that night,
or after"&mdash;she broke down, sobbing under her breath.</p>

<p>"Oh, Geraldine, he could not&mdash;he was hurt you know&mdash;and
Standish intercepted his letter of explanation. But I
mustn't rattle on like this, or I'll leave nothing for Hawthorne
to tell you himself."</p>

<p>Geraldine looked at her with a glorified face.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cissy! Shall I see him soon?"</p>

<p>"He's waiting at the cab, dear, so let us hurry."</p>

<p>She fastened the ribbons of Geraldine's cape, and, taking
her hand, hurried her through the corridor to the stage
door.</p>

<p>And there&mdash;oh, joy of joys! stood Harry Hawthorne,
waiting, with an eager, expectant look.</p>

<p>How Geraldine's heart bounded at the sight of that
handsome face!</p>

<p>She could scarcely restrain herself from springing into
his arms.</p>

<p>But, instead, she demurely held out her little hand, and
he clasped it closely, saying as he led her to the cab:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

</div></div>


<p>It was a long distance from the theatre to Cissy's home,
but the distance was short to Geraldine and her lover, as
they sat side by side in the cab, almost wishing that the
ride would never come to an end, it was so heavenly sweet
to be together again.</p>

<p>Both of them were in secret ecstasies at the catastrophe
to Clifford Standish that had seemed to remove him from
their path forever.</p>

<p>The future seemed to stretch before them roseate, shining,
love-crowned, blissful.</p>

<p>Cissy did her best to explain away all the shadows that
had come between them all.</p>

<p>"Geraldine, I wrote you five letters. Why didn't you
answer them, you cruel girl?"</p>

<p>"Five letters? Oh, Cissy, I never received one of them;
and it almost broke my heart that you would not answer
all the long ones I wrote to you."</p>

<p>"You wrote to me? How strange that I did not get a line
from you, dear. And I was so grieved, so uneasy over you.
I thought you were proud and stubborn. But, tell me&mdash;did
you post them yourself?"</p>

<p>"No; I always gave them to Mr. Standish to send out
with the company's mail."</p>

<p>"Ah! that accounts for all. The wretch intercepted our
letters to each other, just as he did Mr. Hawthorne's
letters to you."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Geraldine; so they told her
the story of the actor's treachery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything lay bare before her now, and she comprehended
that all she had suffered since her parting with
Harry Hawthorne had been brought about by a deep-laid
plot, involving both her happiness and honor; for what if
she had married Standish to-night&mdash;he, who already had a
wife, whom he had deserted!</p>

<p>Her honor would have been trampled in the dust; her
life wrecked, to gratify the base passion of this monster,
whom she had mistakenly believed the embodiment of
truth and goodness.</p>

<p>Trembling with horror at all that she had so narrowly
escaped, Geraldine bowed her head in her hands and
sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>And Harry Hawthorne longed to take her in his arms
and comfort her, but he did not have the right yet, for
only words of friendship had been spoken between them,
and he feared and dreaded that she had given her young
heart to the wretch who had succeeded so well in his vile
plans for parting them in the first flush of their sweet
love-dream.</p>

<p>But now they were at home, and, bidding the cabman
wait, he went in with the girls, saying:</p>

<p>"I know it is rather late to make a call, but something
impels me to have a talk with Miss Harding to-night, if
she will permit me."</p>

<p>She gave a glad assent, seconded by Cissy, who said,
cordially:</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, come in and talk to Geraldine. You are
very excusable under the circumstances."</p>

<p>And, lighting up the poor, but neat, little room, she left
them and retired to the adjoining one, where she busied
herself with little preparations for the morrow, so as not
to embarrass the lovers by her presence.</p>

<p>As for them, when they were left alone, Hawthorne,
still standing, took Geraldine's hand and drew her to him,
gazing into her face with tender, questioning blue eyes.</p>

<p>The answering look in her sweet tearful eyes was so satisfactory
that he said:</p>

<p>"I think everything is explained between us now, is it
not, Geraldine? You must have known before we parted
that fatal day that I loved you!"</p>

<p>She could not speak because of the happy sob in her
throat, but her burning blushes seemed to answer yes,
and he pressed her little hand tighter as he continued:</p>

<p>"Yes, even in the brief time I knew you, dearest, you
had become the one love of my life, treasured in my heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
as the most rare and radiant thing under heaven. And I&mdash;I&mdash;fancied
I read in your sweet smiles that my love would
not be given in vain&mdash;that I should win you for my own!"</p>

<p>It was like the sweetest music in her ears to hear him
telling his love so ardently, with that eager look in his
eyes, and such a quiver of hope and fear in his musical
voice. It was so dear, so sweet, so thrilling, Geraldine
could have listened unweariedly forever.</p>

<p>Oh, first love! what a glimpse through the open gates
of heaven it is to the youthful heart! Nothing that comes
after, even in the longest life, can compare with it in bliss.</p>

<p>It clothes the world in new beauty, makes the sky more
blue, the flowers more fair, the sunlight more golden.</p>

<p>And, thank Heaven, it can gladden the hearts of the
poor and humble as well as the rich and great. None are
so poor that beautiful Love refuses to visit them, or abide
in their hearts.</p>

<p>So to this pair of lovers, though their lot in life was but
lowly, and the roof that sheltered them humble, came as
pure and rich a joy as if they had dwelt in palace halls. Is
it not a glorious provision of Providence that love is free
for all? Not bought like diamonds, although it shines
brighter; not purchased like luxuries, although it is
sweeter, but free as the pure air of heaven, although the
greatest luxury, so that if it had to be bought it would
bring the greatest price of all.</p>

<p>"Oh, Geraldine," cried her lover, "I love you still, I
shall love you always, even if my love prove hopeless, and
changes from bliss to endless pain! But give me some little
hope to feed on, dearest one. Tell me that that base
wretch Standish did not win you with his wicked arts, did
not turn your heart against me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no!" she murmured, faintly, then paused,
abashed, remembering how she had listened to and believed
all the cruel falsehoods against her true lover.</p>

<p>"You believed in me, in spite of all! Oh, how can I
thank you&mdash;&mdash;" he began, but she interrupted.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I was not so noble as you believe, for I thought
he told the truth. But&mdash;but&mdash;it made me wretched, thinking
you were what he said, for&mdash;I could not love him,
though he begged me. I&mdash;I&mdash;loved you, in spite of
all!"</p>

<p>"Geraldine&mdash;my own!" and he caught her to his breast,
their lips meeting in Love's first kiss.</p>

<p>Oh, the happiness of that moment; its never-to-be-forgotten
bliss! It paid for all they had suffered in the months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
that they had been so cruelly parted by the machinations
of a villain.</p>

<p>At last they thought of sitting down, although Hawthorne
said, happily:</p>

<p>"But it must be for only a moment; then I must tear
myself away, and not keep you from your needful rest, my
beloved one. To-morrow I will come again, and feast my
eyes on the sight of you."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not so late, and&mdash;I am not sleepy," she faltered.</p>

<p>"Darling!" and he kissed the sweet lips fondly again;
then, holding her hand, and looking deep in her tender
eyes, he continued: "I am going to ask you for one pledge
of the love you have so sweetly confessed for me, Geraldine.
Promise me that you will never go on the stage
again."</p>

<p>"Oh, never, never! I hate it now, and I will never tread
the boards again!" vowed Geraldine, in eager earnest,
shuddering at thought of the pitfalls Clifford Standish had
spread for her unwary feet, and thanking Heaven in her
secret heart that she had escaped them.</p>

<p>She could not bring herself to confess to her lover that
she had actually promised to marry Standish that night,
and that only a fortunate accident had prevented the consummation
of the horror. Why, even now, instead of this
dear hand-clasp, instead of these dear kisses, she might
have been trembling in silent disgust at the caresses of a
man she could never love! Oh, how good Heaven had been
to save her from the consequences of her own folly, and
restore her to her love again!</p>

<p>She resolved never to tell Hawthorne of that broken engagement.
She felt that she could almost die of shame to
have him find it out.</p>

<p>"I must keep that secret from him, and I must never tell
him, either, that I tried to throw away my life when I
thought him married to another. I should not like him
to know quite how fondly I love him!" she thought, with
sensitive maiden pride.</p>

<p>Then Hawthorne had to tear himself away.</p>

<p>"To-morrow is Christmas, and I shall try to spend it
with you," he said, fondly. "But I may be kept from
your side by a fire, for there are always so many on
Christmas Day. So, if I fail to come, don't let Standish
create any misunderstandings between us again," he
laughed, secure in the thought that his enemy was safe in
prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Geraldine promised very sincerely to trust her love, in
spite of a hundred plots against him, and then they called
Cissy in, and told her happily of their betrothal.</p>

<p>"I am the happiest man in New York to-night," he said,
as he bade them good-night, leaving them to their sweet,
girlish confidences.</p>

<p>How much the two happy girls had to say to each other,
when Hawthorne was gone!</p>

<p>It was long past midnight when they retired, and the
joyous Christmas sounds were already filling the air. Even
then they could not sleep, they had so many things to tell
of all that had happened since they were parted from each
other.</p>

<p>"I am quite cured of my passion for the stage. It seems
to me that all actors must be deceitful villains!" cried
Geraldine, and Cissy agreed with her, glad of her disillusionment.</p>

<p>"Do you think, Cissy," pursued Geraldine, "that I could
get back my place at O'Neill's with you? Oh, I would be
so glad to get back again!"</p>

<p>"We will try to manage it," replied Cissy. "One of the
girls is to be married soon after New Year's, and perhaps
you can have her place. I'll see about it as soon as I go
back to the store; but we have Christmas holiday to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes; what a happy Christmas it will be for me!" cried
Geraldine, thinking of what might have been, with a shudder.
She laughed, to choke back a sob, and continued:
"Let's hang up our stockings to-morrow night, as it's too
late now, and fill them for each other as we did last
Christmas."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Agreed, my dear; it will be great fun," laughed Cissy,
and added: "I suppose your Christmas gift from Mr. Hawthorne
will be&mdash;an engagement-ring."</p>

<p>"Oh, Cissy, how nice that would be! Do you think he
can afford it? Firemen aren't very rich, are they?" naively.</p>

<p>"I guess not; but of course he will give you a ring, even
if it's a plain gold band, that will do also for a marriage-ring
when the wedding comes off."</p>

<p>"No matter how simple a ring he gives me, I shall love
it, and be proud of it, for his sake&mdash;just as proud of it as if
it were a splendid diamond!" cried pretty Geraldine, tenderly,
and then she laughed and said, further: "I used to
be such a silly little goose, thinking I would never love
and marry any man who could not give me silks and diamonds;
but love has changed my nature, and I prize
Harry's love more than anything on earth. Of course, I
still admire beautiful, costly things, but I would not give
him in exchange for a millionaire."</p>

<p>"You are right, dear. Although it is well to have love
and wealth, too, yet love is the best of all, and I would not
barter it for anything on earth," answered Cissy, so earnestly
that Geraldine put her arm around her neck and
whispered, coaxingly:</p>

<p>"Dear, you have always spoken so sweetly of love&mdash;and
yet you do not seem to care for lovers yourself. Why is it?
Have you never loved any one?"</p>

<p>Geraldine felt her companion tremble a little, then she
replied, lightly:</p>

<p>"That is a leading question&mdash;as the lawyers say&mdash;and I
don't believe I will answer it just yet. Wait&mdash;I will tell
you another time."</p>

<p>And her answer only confirmed Geraldine in the belief
she had cherished for a long time that there was a romance
in Cissy's past&mdash;some love-story that had somewhat saddened
her life and made her lips and eyes so sweetly pensive.
From her own happy heart swelled up a silent prayer
that love and joy might come soon to Cissy's life, with the
same rich blessings it brought to her own.</p>

<p>"Now cuddle your head on your pillow, dear, and go off
to the land of Nod, or you will not look pretty for your
sweetheart to-morrow," commanded Cissy; and soon they
were both fast asleep and wandering in the land of dreams,
from which they did not return until the light of day
peeped in at the windows.</p>

<p>"Good gracious! it must be eight o'clock! I've overslept
myself this blessed Christmas morning. A good thing I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
don't have to go to the store to-day!" Cissy cried, springing
out of bed and running to the window, where she
thrust aside the curtain and peered out into the street.</p>

<p>A beautiful sight presented itself&mdash;a great city clothed in
a resplendent mantle of deep snow, that had come between
the dark and the dawn, and overhead a clear, blue sky and
brilliant sunshine.</p>

<p>"Oh, how grand! how beautiful! and what glorious
sleighing there will be to-day! Wake up, Geraldine, and
see the beautiful Christmas morn!" cried the young girl,
who, although she had so little of this world's goods, and
did not expect a single Christmas gift, was unselfishly
happy in the prospect of pleasure for others.</p>

<p>But they had scarcely finished their simple breakfast,
gayly prepared by both their hands, when there was a
knock at the door, and several packages were handed in
for both of them&mdash;a little feast of fruit and confectioneries,
jewel-box, with a dainty pin for Cissy, and another for
Geraldine, with a ring. The gifts bore the card of Harry
Hawthorne.</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely in him to remember me like this! I
shall fall in love with him myself! This dear brooch! How
I adore it! See the dear little enameled violets, with dewy
centers like real diamonds! Oh, how generous he is!" Cissy
cried, rapturously, while Geraldine paled with emotion as
she slipped over her finger a beautiful ring, and held it up
for inspection.</p>

<p>Cissy went almost dumb at the sight, for the stone was a
pure diamond of good size, and worth more than either
girl had any idea of in their ignorance of the value of
gems.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cissy, it is a real diamond, is it not? See how it
glitters!" cried Geraldine, tremulously, as she turned her
hand about, admiring the sparkling rays of light.</p>

<p>She was fairly overwhelmed with joy at this beautiful
gift from her lover, and continued, breathlessly:</p>

<p>"Oh, it is so beautiful! I am so proud to have it! But&mdash;but&mdash;wasn't
he rather&mdash;extravagant, Cissy? I should not
have thought he could afford it, for surely it must have
cost a hundred dollars at least&mdash;don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"More than that, in my judgment," cried Cissy, finding
breath after her rapturous amazement, and continuing:
"But it is none too pretty or costly for you, my beautiful
darling, if he can afford it; and of course he can, or he
would not have sent it. Perhaps he is not as poor as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
thought. He looks like a prince in disguise, anyway, he's
so stately and handsome!"</p>

<p>She paused, for Geraldine had found a note in the box,
and was reading it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Own Darling</span>:&mdash;I am disconsolate this morning because
I could not get leave of absence to come to you,"
wrote Hawthorne, fondly, "but I couldn't get a man to
take my place at the engine-house to-day, and I daren't
desert my post, for there have been two fires already this
morning, and I was out with my engine in the driving
snow of dawn, while you, I hope, were wrapped in slumber
and sweet dreams of your adoring sweetheart!</p>

<p>"Isn't the snow fine? I shall try my hardest to get off
in time to take you and Cissy for a grand sleigh-ride before
the day is ended.</p>

<p>"I send you both some bon-bons and fruits, with a
brooch for Cissy, and a ring for you. You will be asking
yourself how can a poor fireman afford to give diamonds
to his betrothed and her dear friend! Well, darling, both
trinkets were heir-looms from my dead mother, who was
richer in worldly goods than her son. So the little mystery
is explained.</p>

<p>"God bless you and keep you, my beloved, until we
meet again, which I trust and hope may be this afternoon.</p>

<p class="center">
"Devotedly,<br />
</p>
<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Harry</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Geraldine gave her friend the note to read, then they
discussed some of the dainties, while Cissy said, regretfully:</p>

<p>"If I had only known yesterday that I should have you
with me to-day, I should have prepared a real little feast
for our dinner, but I felt so lonely and sad I prepared
nothing extra, and now I really must slip out and buy
something good. What would you like, dear&mdash;a dear little
chicken and some oysters? For a turkey would be too big
for us two!"</p>

<p>"Oh, some oysters, please; I am so fond of them, and
they are not so good out West, where I traveled so long,"
cried Geraldine, with real girlish delight, it seemed so
jolly to be back with Cissy, playing at housekeeping
again.</p>

<p>"I'll never leave my darling again until&mdash;I marry!" she
thought, with kindling blushes, and while Cissy was gone
she employed her time writing a very polite note to Mr.
Cameron Clemens, the manager of the Clemens Company,
resigning her situation, to take effect at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>When she remembered Mr. Clemens, she felt a little remorseful
over her denunciation of all actors last night, for
she had found this one very kind and clever during her
engagement with the company.</p>

<p>She went down stairs and engaged the landlady's son to
take her note at once to the hotel where the manager was
staying, and then tried to dismiss the matter from her
mind, but she felt a little remorseful, for Laurel Vane
was billed to appear again to-night, and she knew it could
not go on, now that she and Standish had both withdrawn&mdash;that
was, of course, unless the latter could get free from
prison, which did not seem likely, considering the nature
of the charge against him.</p>

<p>When Cissy came in, Geraldine said, happily:</p>

<p>"I feel as free as a bird, for I have sent in my resignation
in the Clemens Company, and now I shall not have to
leave you any more."</p>

<p>"Until Mr. Hawthorne steals you away from me,"
amended Cissy, kissing her rosy cheek before she hurried
into the adjoining room to prepare her little Christmas
dinner.</p>

<p>"Let me help you!" pleaded Geraldine.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you shall be company come to dine to-day.
And, besides, you must stay dressed up, to receive callers."</p>

<p>"But there's no one to call."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there is," and her words proved true, for before
the day ended there came Mrs. Stansbury, with her
three sisters, Carrie, Consuelo, and Mrs. Charles Butler,
the lovely bride of whom Geraldine had been so horribly
jealous.</p>

<p>How glad they all were to see her again; how they
petted and made much of her, denouncing Clifford Standish
for a real villain.</p>

<p>"And you're engaged to that splendid Hawthorne&mdash;how
charming! Oh, you needn't blush! He told my husband
this morning, and we all hurried off to wish you joy,"
cried volatile Mrs. Stansbury.</p>

</div></div>


<p>At last the Stansburys were gone, but then some of the
girls from O'Neill's dropped in. It was a merry, happy
day to Geraldine, with but one shadow on its brightness&mdash;the
absence of Hawthorne.</p>

<p>At every knock she started up, all blissful, blushing confusion,
thinking that surely this time it was he, but each
time she was doomed to a sad disappointment.</p>

<p>But from the constant ringing of fire alarms through the
day she easily guessed what kept him from her side.</p>

<p>But when the afternoon was far spent, and the sunlight
grew pale and cold, there was a masculine step at the door
that made her heart throb quickly again with eager hope
as she sprang to open it, thinking:</p>

<p>"I cannot be mistaken. He is come at last!"</p>

<p>But the next moment she stood face to face with the
handsome manager, Cameron Clemens.</p>

<p>And as he entered there was a soft little swish of skirts
as Cissy fled to the next room.</p>

<p>"How she hates anybody connected with the stage!"
thought Geraldine, amusedly.</p>

<p>The manager had come to entreat her to reconsider her
resignation.</p>

<p>He could get some one else to take the place of Standish
in the play, if she would only go on, he said.</p>

<p>But Geraldine was obdurate. She told the manager
frankly that she was engaged, and her betrothed objected
to her return to the stage.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry for your disappointment," she said;
"I like you, and you have been very kind to me, but my
betrothed objects, you see, and that settles the case with
me."</p>

<p>Mr. Clemens did not fly into a rage, as many another
would have done in his place. He wished Geraldine joy,
told her that the stage had lost an ornament in her withdrawal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
from it, presented her with the amount of salary
still due her, and took a courteous leave.</p>

<p>He knew that he could put on another play, in which the
remainder of the company could do very well that night,
but he sorely regretted the loss of Geraldine, who had certainly
proved a drawing card.</p>

<p>But he could not help the turn of events, so he went his
way, bitterly disappointed, while Geraldine called into the
other room:</p>

<p>"You can come back now, Cissy, for Mr. Clemens is
gone. But, you silly girl, why did you run away? I wished
you to know him, he is so nice and handsome!"</p>

<p>There was no answer from her friend, and she went back
into the room.</p>

<p>There was Cissy, on a low seat in the darkest corner,
and presently there came a low, stifled sob.</p>

<p>Geraldine flung herself on her knees by her friend, in
great surprise and alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling girl! what ails you? Are you sick?
Did the bonbons disagree with you?"</p>

<p>"No-o-o!" sighed Cissy.</p>

<p>"Then what is it, dear? Are you in trouble? Or were
you angry because the manager came here? But this shall
be the last of any stage visitors, I assure you! Or do you
want me to go away, Cissy?" plaintively.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gerry, you will drive me mad with your questions!
I'll have to tell you my guarded secret!"</p>

</p>


<p>Most bitter were the reflections of the elegant villain,
Clifford Standish, during the long night in his prison-cell.</p>

<p>He knew too well that the charge against him was perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
true, and that his boast to Geraldine that he would
clear himself at court was absolutely false.</p>

<p>Two years before, he had secretly married a piquant
variety actress, of whom he had soon wearied, but from
whose fetters he could not get free.</p>

<p>Her life was absolutely irreproachable, and he could
find no flaw in it on which to base an application for divorce.</p>

<p>And all of his flagrant violations of faith, although
known too well to his wife, did not goad her to seek release
from him.</p>

<p>She loved him, poor creature, with that dog-like devotion
seen in some women of average intellect, who love the
hand that smites them. She was romantic, and called it
constancy; other women called it lack of spirit.</p>

<p>She could not and did not comprehend the baseness of
the man she loved.</p>

<p>The end and aim of her poor, wrecked life was to win
him back to the allegiance of which he had wearied so
soon.</p>

<p>Although she dared not disregard his injunction not to
reveal their marriage, she followed him about as often as
her engagements would permit, trying to keep track of his
movements.</p>

<p>When he was away from the city, she wrote him long
love-letters, over which he laughed in heartless amusement.</p>

<p>It was one of these letters that he had pretended to read
to Geraldine on the bridge at Alderson, claiming that it
contained news of Hawthorne's marriage.</p>

<p>It was this woman who had prevented him from accompanying
Geraldine to Newburgh, by threatening to reveal
his fatal secret.</p>

<p>At length, driven almost mad by his fiendish conduct,
she had thrown caution to the winds, and caused his arrest
on the stage that night for desertion.</p>

<p>But she would have trembled with fear could she have
heard his threats against her that night as he raged up and
down his prison-cell, execrating her as the cause of his
losing pretty Geraldine forever.</p>

<p>"A few more hours and my peerless girl would have
been mine, all mine! Oh, to miss happiness by so slight a
chance, it is horrible, and dearly shall that woman pay for
this!" he swore.</p>

<p>But he knew that his wrath was futile, for she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
have all the proofs of his conduct ready to cover him with
shame in the morning.</p>

<p>The morning found him sullen, bitter, desperate. The
policemen said afterward that his eyes looked actually
fiendish when he was placed in the Black Maria to be conveyed
to the court-house in Chambers street.</p>

<p>That fiendish look was still in his eyes when they started
to transfer him from the vehicle to the court-house, and&mdash;how
it exactly happened they never could tell&mdash;but the
seemingly quiet prisoner whom they had not thought it
necessary to handcuff, suddenly struck out with two athletic
fists, landing one startled policeman on the snowy
pavement, and the other one flat in the gutter. Then he
fled like a professional sprinter, and nobody tried to stop
him, perhaps because they pitied the poor devil, and
wished him his liberty this glorious Christmas morning.</p>

<p>"I must tell you my guarded secret," sobbed Cissy, to
Geraldine, and the latter put a loving arm around her,
whispering, tenderly:</p>

<p>"Yes, tell me all, dear; for maybe it will ease your sore
heart. You know the poet says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Give sorrow words&mdash;the grief that does not speak<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last rays of the setting sun stole in and rested like a
blessing on the dark and golden heads close together, then
faded out, and left the little room in gloom as Cissy sighed:</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought I was getting over it; I thought I was
contented again until his voice and face brought back the
cruel past!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whose voice and face, dear Cissy? Oh, do you mean
Mr. Clemens? Did he have anything to do with your secret
sorrow?"</p>

<p>"Everything!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, and was that why you rushed away when he
entered the room?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es," sobbed Cissy.</p>

<p>"Why, this grows very interesting," exclaimed Geraldine,
who dearly loved a romance. "Why, I never even
dreamed of your knowing Cameron Clemens! Why didn't
you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I did not wish to do so. I did not mean to resurrect
my sorrow from the grave where it has rested for years.
Oh, why have I promised to tell it now?" began Cissy,
suddenly repenting her weakness.</p>

<p>"Oh, darling, I'll never, never breathe it to a living soul,
poor dear. Now go on, that's a sweet girl! Was Mr. Clemens
your lover?"</p>

<p>But as the last word left her lips there came a loud, impatient
double knock upon the door, making both spring
up in surprise and alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" cried Geraldine.</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" echoed Cissy.</p>

<p>Then they smiled at each other in the deepening gloom,
and Geraldine exclaimed:</p>

<p>"How that knock startled me! But, of course, it's Harry
at last."</p>

<p>He was Harry to her now, her darling, and how sweet
the name sounded from her rosy lips.</p>

<p>"Of course it is Harry. Run to the door, dear," returned
Cissy, secretly glad of an interruption to the story she
had promised to relate to her friend.</p>

<p>All in a moment she had repented it, and wished to
keep the secret still.</p>

<p>So she was glad of the opportune interruption.</p>

<p>"Run to the door, dear. Do not keep him waiting," she
urged, and Geraldine flew blithely to open the door for
her lover, as she had done a dozen times before that day,
meeting each time, as she did now&mdash;blank disappointment.</p>

<p>A man stood before her, to be sure, but he was an utter
stranger&mdash;good-looking and well-dressed, with a bearded
face and a hat pulled low over his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Are you Miss Harding?" he asked, in a low, muffled
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>He handed a note to her; and forgetting, in her wonder,
to ask him in, she took it, and leaving him at the open
door, crossed over to the window to read it by the dim
and failing light of the waning day.</p>

<p>It ran simply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My darling, there have been so many fires to-day I've
been on a dead run, and am almost tired out; but I didn't
forget my promise to take you for a sleigh-ride, and the
thought of you has been singing in my fond heart all day.
It's late, I know&mdash;past five now, and I can't get off duty at
the engine-house until six o'clock; but I thought I would
take time by the forelock and be ready to take you for a
little spin, if you don't mind the hour. So my friend, Jem
Rhodes volunteered to go to the livery stable and get a
sleigh for me, and bring you down to the engine-house by
six o'clock, so I could take the reins the minute I'm free.</p>

<p>"Will you come with my good friend, Rhodes, dear? A
clever fellow to do us this good turn, is he not?</p>

<p class="center">
"Hastily and fondly,<br />
</p>
<p class="sig">
H. H."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the dim light the writing looked the same as that she
had received that morning from her lover. Not a doubt
crossed her mind.</p>

<p>She hastily explained the case to her friend.</p>

<p>Cissy could see no objection to the plan, and she was
rather relieved that Geraldine was going, so that she
could not tease her for the love-story she was now reluctant
to tell.</p>

<p>"It seems all right," she said, encouragingly.</p>

<p>Geraldine flew to get on her warmest wraps, and Cissy
invited Mr. Rhodes to come in to the fire.</p>

<p>"I will light the gas," she said, hospitably, but he
shrank back into the shadowy hall.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, I must go down and look after the
horses. Please tell the young lady to hurry," he said, in
that strange, muffled voice, retreating down the stair-way
as he spoke.</p>

<p>Geraldine was ready in a minute, and Cissy went down
with her to the sleigh, an elegant turn-out, with two horses.</p>

<p>"Don't stay too late, dear, or you may take cold," cautioned
Cissy, tenderly; and then they kissed each other
good-by, little dreaming how long it would be, poor dears,
before they met and kissed again.</p>

</div></div>


<p>Cissy went back to her lonely rooms, stirred up the fire
to a brighter blaze in the tiny stove, then sat down to a
dreary retrospection of past days, her small hands folded
idly in her lap, her dark head bowed in sadness.</p>

<p>The sight of the handsome actor-manager, Cameron
Clemens, had brought her memories from the past sweet
and bitter in a breath, kindling old love and renewing old
pain.</p>

<p>"How dared he come? He must have known that Geraldine
was with me! Did he think I would ever willingly
meet him again?" she murmured, bitterly; then started to
her feet, for there was another masculine rap upon the
door.</p>

<p>"Who is it this time?" she wondered, as she opened the
door.</p>

<p>A cry of surprise came from her lips for there stood
Harry Hawthorne, handsome as a picture, in citizen's
dress, his fireman's uniform laid aside, his stately figure
looking its best in a long fur-lined overcoat.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Miss Carroll. May I come in?" he asked,
gayly, with that ring of happiness in his musical voice one
hears from a recently accepted lover.</p>

<p>"Come in," Cissy answered, mechanically, in her amazement,
letting him enter and close the door ere she asked,
uneasily:</p>

<p>"Where's Geraldine? Didn't she come back with you?"</p>

<p>"With me? I don't understand you. I've just got away
from my duties at the engine-house, and I thought if you
and Geraldine didn't mind going out at night, we could
have our sleigh-ride yet. There will be moonlight after a
while."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Cissy grasped the back of a chair to steady herself.
Her face was pale, her dove-eyes dilated.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;didn't you send a sleigh here just now for Geraldine?"
she gasped.</p>

<p>It was his turn now to look startled, and his eyes went
from her face to the next room as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Isn't Geraldine here now?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;of course not. Didn't I just tell you that she
went away just now in a sleigh that you sent to bring her
to the engine-house?" answered Cissy, turning up the
light in a mechanical way, as women will attend to trifles
even in trouble.</p>

<p>She saw that he was deadly pale and excited, and he
said, in a strained voice:</p>

<p>"But I did not send any sleigh. There must be some
mistake."</p>

<p>"There is treachery somewhere. Oh, why did I let her
go, poor child?" cried Cissy, with a sudden awful presentiment
of evil.</p>

<p>He sank into a chair, trembling with dread.</p>

<p>"Tell me quickly what you mean&mdash;give me every clew
you can&mdash;for I must go in search of her," he exclaimed,
anxiously.</p>

<p>And Cissy told him about the man, Jem Rhodes, and the
note, and the elegant sleigh in which Geraldine had gone
away so blithely, her rosy face radiant with joy, thinking
to meet her lover.</p>

<p>"Why, there is the note now," she said, taking it up
from the table where Geraldine had left it, and handing it
to Hawthorne.</p>

<p>He ran over it hastily, his blue eyes flashing with anger
and apprehension.</p>

<p>"I never wrote this note&mdash;it is not in my writing! How
did Geraldine ever make such a mistake?" he cried,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"She read it hastily by a dim light," said Cissy.</p>

<p>"And there is just enough likeness to my hand to have
deceived her that way," he cried, in anguish, for the conviction
of something dreadful had come to him. "Oh, my
darling, you are the victim of some cruel plot," he
groaned, his handsome face blanching to a deathly hue.</p>

<p>Poor Cissy breathed, faintly:</p>

<p>"Oh, who could have planned this outrage? Clifford
Standish is the only man I know likely to be guilty of it.
But he is in prison."</p>

<p>"Have you not heard? The villain escaped from the officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
at the door of the Chambers street court-house this
morning, and is still at large. No doubt he wrote this
fraudulent note; no doubt it was he who carried Geraldine
off. Tell me what the wretch looked like."</p>

<p>Then Cissy remembered that the man Rhodes had refused
to enter the lighted room, and had been strangely
taciturn, speaking only when necessity required, and then
in a low, muffled voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, I ought to have suspected him then. I was culpably
careless and thoughtless, letting that poor child go with
him," she thought, in an agony of distress.</p>

<p>When she had described the man to Hawthorne, he declared
his belief that Standish himself, with but slight disguise,
had personated the mythical Jem Rhodes.</p>

<p>"She is in the power of that fiend at this moment!" he
exclaimed, starting up in a passion of grief and anguish
that made poor Cissy burst out into hysterical weeping.</p>

<p>He was rushing to the door, and he looked back at the
sound of her sobs, and said, gently:</p>

<p>"Don't take it so hard, Miss Carroll, for Heaven's sake.
You are not to blame, neither was she, for that note was
plausible enough to deceive any one. But I'll find her and
bring her back to you, or I'll have that villain's cursed
life!"</p>

<p>We must follow Clifford Standish on his successful flight
from justice that Christmas morning, when the spirit of
the day was so much in every heart that no one who witnessed
his escape cared to give chase to the fugitive.
Perhaps, indeed, they thought that one who could outwit
two stalwart policemen deserved his liberty.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the actor made good his escape to a
place of refuge, where he lay a while <i>perdu</i>, concocting
new plans for retrieving last night's disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>The thought that he had lost pretty Geraldine forever
was bitterness to his heart.</p>

<p>But he felt just as certain of it as if he had witnessed all
that had transpired last night.</p>

<p>He knew well that when he was not by to guard Geraldine,
that her friends in the box would swoop down upon
her and carry her off in triumph.</p>

<p>There would be fond meetings, eager explanations, and
all his treachery to her would be painted in its blackest
colors. His only hold on her esteem, her touching belief in
his truth and goodness, would be destroyed.</p>

<p>He would stand forth in his true colors before her horrified
eyes&mdash;a black-hearted wretch, the husband of another
woman, who had sought by the blackest lies and foulest
arts to lure her&mdash;pretty Geraldine&mdash;to irrevocable ruin.</p>

<p>She would thank God that He had interfered in time to
save her from him at almost the very last moment.</p>

<p>Standish gnashed his teeth as he thought of her joy over
her escape, for he knew well how she had secretly shrunk
from him, though out of her wounded pride she had promised
him her hand.</p>

<p>He guessed well that all was explained between her and
Hawthorne now, and that they were already betrothed
lovers.</p>

<p>If hate could have killed this pair in their exquisite happiness,
then Clifford Standish would have sent a bolt of it
to strike both of them dead.</p>

<p>In his jealous fury he raged and swore almost constantly.
The little room he occupied became stifling with the fumes
of wine and tobacco that he used to solace him in his terrible
defeat.</p>

<p>But he was careful not to drink too much. He did not
wish to stupefy his brain.</p>

<p>He wished to keep it clear that he might plot new deviltry.</p>

<p>Almost any man in his place would have given up the
game after being so signally worsted by fate.</p>

<p>Not so with Clifford Standish. The stroke of adversity
only roused in him a devilish obstinacy, a determination
to rule or ruin.</p>

<p>Hate for Harry Hawthorne, and a mad passion for Geraldine
Harding, drove him on to new wickedness.</p>

<p>He spent a good part of the day in seclusion, laying his
wicked plans, like a crafty spider weaving his web; then,
disguising himself with a wig, beard, glasses, and cosmetics,
dressed himself in a cheap new suit, and sallied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
forth to victory. No look of Clifford Standish remained except
the stately walk, and even this he could change at
will.</p>

<p>So, later on, he imposed on Geraldine and Cissy as Jem
Rhodes, the trusty friend of the fireman.</p>

<p>But, before coming on his fatal mission, he had informed
himself as to everything that was necessary to make the
daring abduction he had planned an absolute success.</p>

<p>He knew that Harry Hawthorne had become engaged to
Geraldine through eavesdropping at the door when the
Stansburys called on her. He had also heard her tell them
that she and Cissy were to have a grand sleigh-ride with
Harry, although it might be late in the day when he got
off duty.</p>

<p>The unsuspected listener smiled grimly to himself as he
muttered:</p>

<p>"You shall certainly have your sleigh-ride, my little
beauty, but not with your Harry and Cissy&mdash;no, indeed!"</p>

<p>Between the hours of five and six he sought a livery
stable, and asked for a driver and sleigh to take himself
and a lady to the Cortlandt street ferry.</p>

<p>As the stable keeper was a stranger to him, he did not
think it necessary to disguise his voice; but spoke in his
natural tone, and a youth who was lounging about the
office started and gave him a keen, curious glance.</p>

<p>Standish did not notice the young man, or he would
have perhaps recognized him as the messenger-boy from
the hospital where Harry Hawthorne had been taken after
the accident&mdash;the youth from whom he had taken the letter
to Geraldine.</p>

<p>Robert had promised Hawthorne that he would at some
time pay Standish for his treachery, but fate had been unkind
to him so far in the continued absence of Standish
from the city, and the youth had almost forgotten the incident
until the clear, ringing voice of Standish, familiar
to his ears from hearing it on the stage, broke on him,
awakening remembrance like a flash of light.</p>

<p>He started and gave him a keen glance that quickly penetrated
the actor's disguise, especially as he was off guard
for the moment, and his square shoulders and erect bearing
betrayed him to those suspicious eyes.</p>

<p>Robert shrank back into the shadow, thinking:</p>

<p>"So he's got back to town, that scamp! Now I wonder
what he's up to in that disguise? But he can't fool me! I
know his voice and his square shoulders too well. I wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
I could do him up, the grand villain, for playing me that
low trick!"</p>

<p>On the alert for something on which to base a plan of retaliation,
he followed every word and movement, and, to
his amazement, when Standish got into the elegant sleigh,
he heard him give the address of Geraldine, where he had
carried Hawthorne's note.</p>

<p>Now, Robert had left the hospital, and obtained a place
with his cousin, the keeper of the livery stable, and a wild
thought came into his mind.</p>

<p>"That fellow's up to some mischief, or he wouldn't be in
that rig&mdash;whiskers and spectacles! Wonder if that girl's
got back, anyway? S'pose I go and tell the fireman about
it, and see if he can make anything out of this strange
lark?"</p>

<p>Turning to his cousin, who was very fond of the quick-witted
youth, he said, roguishly:</p>

<p>"Seems like that fellow's going to take his best girl for
a jolly sleigh-ride. Puts me in mind to take mine, too.
Can't I get off for an hour and have a little one-horse
sleigh?"</p>

<p>"Who's to pay for it, Impudence?"</p>

<p>"I am, of course! You can keep my week's salary for it.
Who minds a little extravagance like that for his best girl,
I'd like to know?" and ten minutes later he was driving
in style to the Ludlow street engine-house.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hawthorne in the house?" he hallooed to a fireman
in front.</p>

<p>"Too late, sonny. He left fifteen minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Where to?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, really."</p>

<p>"Can't you form some idea, please?" the boy cried,
dropping the jaunty air in some anxiety.</p>

<p>The blue-shirted fireman stuck his hands in his pocket,
whistled, and answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, he's gone to see his best girl, I reckon."</p>

<p>"What's her name?" queried Robert, wondering if Hawthorne
was off with the old love, and on with a new one.</p>

<p>"I don't know," and Robert was about to turn off in disgust
at the good-natured levity of the other when Captain
Stansbury, who was inside, overheard him, and came to
the rescue.</p>

<p>"You want Hawthorne?" he said. "Well, he isn't here."</p>

<p>"I know, but I want him very particular. Can't you tell
me where to find him?"</p>

<p>The genial captain laughed, and answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can tell you, but I can also tell you, young man, that
he doesn't like to be bothered when he goes a-courting!"</p>

<p>"Has he gone to see Miss Harding?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"At the old address?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Thank you," and Robert whirled his keen little cutter
about, and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>"A likely lad," laughed the fireman, and then he and
the captain went indoors.</p>

<p>Five minutes later a double sleigh whirled around the
nearest corner, and came to a sudden stop in front of the
engine-house. A man got out in the snow, and waded over
to the door, followed by the yearning eyes of a girl whose
fair face glowed like a rose, it was so beautiful in its eager
tenderness.</p>

<p>"Oh, my love, how long the day has been without you,
but I shall see you at last!" she whispered to herself,
fondly.</p>

<p>The man went inside the double-doors and looked at
the splendid horses neighing in their stalls. No one was
in sight. The men were back in the office amusing themselves
with a game of cards. He could hear them laughing
and bantering each other.</p>

<p>He remained there a moment out of sight of Geraldine,
then, with a sigh of relief, hurried back to the sleigh.</p>

<p>"It's very strange, but Mr. Hawthorne has gone," he
said, in that thick, muffled voice. "He left word for me to
bring you to Cortlandt street ferry."</p>

<p>"That is so far. I think he might have waited for us,"
the girl said, half to herself, and pettishly.</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe there was a fire down that way," Jem
Rhodes returned, plausibly. "Go on, driver."</p>

<p>As they started, Captain Stansbury, who fancied he had
heard something stopping outside, came and looked out
and Geraldine saw his portly figure framed there a moment
in the glare of an electric light.</p>

<p>She looked back, but he did not recognize her as the
sleigh whirled past. Alas! why did not some subtle voice
in her heart warn her that she was in deadly peril, and
make her cry out to him to follow and save her from the
snare into which she had fallen?</p>

<p>The call at the engine-house was only a part of the
actor's plan for lulling Geraldine's suspicions to rest.</p>

<p>It had succeeded splendidly, and, with an exultant
heart, he resumed his place by her side, burning with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
desire to take her fair form in his arms and crush it against
his breast.</p>

<p>But the time for this was not yet. He must first carry
out one of the most daring plans ever conceived by man to
elope with an unwilling beauty and make her his by sheer
force of fraud and impudence.</p>

<p>And the worst of it all lay before him.</p>

<p>He was succeeding well in his plan for getting her to
the ferry, but after that, how was he to manage?</p>

<p>When Robert returned from the engine-house, he was in
doubt whether he ought to follow Hawthorne or not.</p>

<p>"If he has gone to Miss Harding's house, everything
must be all right between them. It must be some other
lady in the same house that Standish is going to take
away. It's a lodging-house, and he may be acquainted
with a dozen ladies there, for all I know."</p>

<p>But still, in spite of these thoughts, he kept on driving
to the house.</p>

<p>"I'll go past it anyway, and see if the fellow is there
yet with his grand sleigh."</p>

<p>He threw himself back with an air of importance, for he
was certainly enjoying his little outing. The road was gay
with vehicles, and the air musical with the ring of sleigh-bells.
New York was enjoying its Christmas.</p>

<p>Almost before he realized it, he found himself on the
obscure street, and in front of the shabby house where
Geraldine lived, a pure pearl in an uncouth setting.</p>

<p>He reined up in front of the house and cogitated:</p>

<p>"The sleigh isn't here. Mr. Standish must have got his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
girl and gone. Maybe I ought to go, too. I don't see that I
have any business going in!"</p>

<p>Smiling to himself at his humorous play on the verb to
go, he waited a minute, glancing curiously at the front of
the four-story house that looked dark and still as though
most of the people had gone out or retired.</p>

<p>He pictured to himself the handsome fireman within
that tenement, sitting by the side of his sweet young love,
Geraldine, perhaps holding her dainty hand and looking
love into eyes that answered love again.</p>

<p>"No, I mustn't go in. I might interrupt a charming
<i>tete-a-tete</i>," he decided, and was about to turn back to
the livery stable, when the door before him opened suddenly,
and a man appeared, reeling down the steps like
one under the influence of liquor or some heart-breaking
emotion.</p>

<p>Robert stared at the handsome figure a moment, then
called, questioningly:</p>

<p>"Mr. Hawthorne?"</p>

<p>Hawthorne stopped, looked up, and asked, hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Who is that? Oh, Robert, is it you? What are you
doing here?"</p>

<p>"I came to see you, Mr. Hawthorne."</p>

<p>"What can I do for you? Speak quickly, for I'm going&mdash;oh,
God! where&mdash;for I know not where to turn!"</p>

<p>The words were a cry of agony, and as he came up to
the side of the sleigh, the youth saw that his face was
deathly pale, as if from terrible trouble.</p>

<p>His first fear that Hawthorne was intoxicated gave way
to the conviction that something was wrong about Geraldine,
and he said, quickly:</p>

<p>"You're in trouble, sir, and I think I can help you if
you'll tell me all about it. Get in the sleigh, won't you,
and let me drive you wherever you want to go."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Robert. I came on a car, and this is very
welcome," said Hawthorne, getting in by the youth's side.</p>

<p>"Where to?" asked Robert, taking up the reins.</p>

<p>"Where? Oh, God, where!" groaned Hawthorne, despairingly.
"Wait," he added, laying his hand on the
boy's shoulder. "Ah, Robert, this is one of the darkest
hours of a life that has had many shadows. I came here
to see my betrothed bride, my heart full of joy that has
turned to keenest pain, for I found her gone from me&mdash;lured
away by a scheming villain that she hates&mdash;and
what her terrible fate may be, God only knows, for I have
not a single clew to follow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you have&mdash;a clew to follow the villain himself.
You mean Standish, don't you?" shouted Robert,
wildly, in his excitement.</p>

<p>"Yes, he has lured her away by a cunning trick&mdash;"
began Hawthorne again, but the youth interrupted:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know; he has taken her to the Cortlandt
street ferry&mdash;going to elope with her, I reckon. But we'll
follow and outwit the villain," and chirping to his horse,
Robert drove to the ferry as fast as he dared.</p>

<p>On the way he told Hawthorne all that he knew, and
received his confidence in turn.</p>

<p>So the actor's plot was laid bare. No doubt existed as
to his intentions to abduct Geraldine.</p>

<p>On their way, just half a block from the ferry, Robert
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There's our sleigh going back now to the stables.
Hello, Pete!"</p>

<p>The driver drew rein, and he asked, anxiously:</p>

<p>"Where's the lady and gentleman you took down to the
ferry?"</p>

<p>And the answer was like the trump of doom to Hawthorne's
sore heart.</p>

<p>"The lady and gentleman, sir? Oh, they took the Pennsylvania
Limited train to Chicago."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" cried Robert.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I crossed the river with them, and saw them
board the train. That is, the man carried her in his arms.
She got sick, or fainted, maybe, just beforehand, and he
grabbed her up and climbed on with her just as the
whistle blew. Oh, they're off, for sure. Is anything
wrong?" added the driver, curiously, scenting an elopement.</p>

<p>The curious sleigh-driver got no answer to his question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert touched up his horse, and it bounded toward the
ferry.</p>

<p>"What now?" queried Hawthorne, in a dazed way, so
crushed by the shock he had received that he was for the
moment incapable of coherent thought.</p>

<p>The quick-witted youth answered, readily:</p>

<p>"Aren't we going to telegraph ahead to arrest Standish
at the first station?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;oh, yes, of course we are; but I was so dazed by
this shock that it seemed impossible for the moment for
me to think clearly. Thank you for suggesting something,
Robert. Perhaps, after all, we may foil the villain!" exclaimed
Hawthorne, gladly and gratefully.</p>

<p>The youth smiled, well pleased at this praise from Hawthorne,
and they proceeded on their way.</p>

<p>The telegram to arrest Standish having been sent, the
pair next drove to Police Headquarters, where they lodged
information of the whereabouts of Standish, who was
wanted now, not only on the warrant of wife desertion,
but for knocking over the policemen in his escape that
morning.</p>

<p>"What next?" queried Robert, when they were once
more seated in the sleigh.</p>

<p>"My good fellow, are you not weary of my troubles
yet?" cried the grateful Hawthorne.</p>

<p>"I want to help you in every way I can, Mr. Hawthorne,
not only because I like you, sir, but because I'm interested
in that sweet young girl, and I also have a grudge
against that wretch, Standish, for the trick he played all
of us once. So now there's three motives urging me on,
and you may command my services just as long as you
have need of them," returned the intelligent youth, so
earnestly that Hawthorne wrung his hand gratefully, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Believe me, I'll never, never, forget this kindness."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," returned the gratified youth, and
added:</p>

<p>"But what can we do next?"</p>

<p>"You can drive me back to the ferry, Robert, for I shall
follow Geraldine on the first train. Think how lonely and
terrified she will be with that wretch, who has told her,
God only knows what artful story, to get her aboard the
train with him. I must go to her assistance as fast as I
can."</p>

<p>"You are right, sir, for she must be frightened almost to
death. By Jove, but I'd like to go with you and see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
fellow's face when he meets you, but I must go back with
the sleigh."</p>

<p>"And, besides, I have another task for you, my faithful
Robert. It is to return to the engine-house when I am
gone, and tell Captain Stansbury all that we have discovered.
From the engine-house back to Geraldine's home,
and tell the young lady, Miss Carroll, the same story,"
continued Hawthorne, mindful of Cissy's cruel anxiety,
and anxious to relieve it by some certainty of what had
really happened.</p>

<p>"Tell Miss Carroll to keep up her spirits&mdash;that I will certainly
bring Miss Harding back by to-morrow," he added,
hopefully.</p>

<p>It was a sad ending for the Christmas Day that had
dawned so pleasantly for the just reunited lovers, but
Hawthorne would not permit himself to dwell despairingly
on it. He told himself that by this time to-morrow he
would be sure to have Geraldine back again.</p>

<p>Pete, the driver of the sleigh in which Clifford Standish
had so successfully accomplished the abduction of Geraldine,
had told the truth about the affair.</p>

<p>Geraldine had indeed fainted at some words he had said
to her, and while in this condition he had lifted her in his
arms and carried her aboard the train.</p>

<p>Ere she recovered from her long spell of unconsciousness,
the train was flying across the country in the gloom of the
falling night, that, dark as it was, could not equal the
blackness of the fate to which Clifford Standish had destined
his hapless victim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>On reaching the station he had said, abruptly, to Geraldine:</p>

<p>"Kindly wait here for me while I go and find Hawthorne."</p>

<p>In reality he secured tickets for Chicago, and, returning
to her, he said, still in that strange, muffled voice of his:</p>

<p>"The time has come for me to explain why Hawthorne
trusted you to my care to bring you here."</p>

<p>"Did you not find him?" exclaimed Geraldine, uneasily.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is he not coming to me? This looks strange!" she said,
with rising resentment.</p>

<p>"Be patient, Miss Harding, and let me explain," he said,
wheedlingly.</p>

<p>They were standing at an obscure place on the platform,
and very few people were about except the depot officials.
No one noticed the tall, bearded man and his beautiful
companion, with her great starry brown eyes and masses
of sunshiny hair.</p>

<p>Standish proceeded, in an oily voice:</p>

<p>"Something shocking happened to my friend Hawthorne
this afternoon, and he is compelled to flee the city on this
train that you see them making up now. He is watched
for at every station in the city, so he dare not come to you
now, for his arrest is certain. His sending for you was a
desperate expedient to see you once more and bid you farewell
forever, or&mdash;to take you with him in his flight from
justice."</p>

<p>With every word he uttered he saw her face grow paler
and paler, her large eyes widening with nameless fear;
but, without pausing for her to speak, he continued, rapidly:</p>

<p>"He is mad with remorse over the awful deed he has
done, and wild with grief at the thought of leaving you.
He says that you have promised to marry him, and why
not now as well as later? He prays you to go with him
now on his exile, and to become his bride as soon as his
destination is reached."</p>

<p>Her pale lips parted, and she interrupted.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me see him, let me speak to him! This is so
horrible, so sudden!"</p>

<p>"You will have to board the train to see him. He is in
the rear car, having slipped on almost under the eyes of
an officer watching for him. Come," and he attempted to
take her hand and draw her forward.</p>

<p>But she shrank back in nameless terror, moaning:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I&mdash;can't&mdash;go! I am afraid. Oh, tell me what it is
that he has done!"</p>

<p>He bent closer, muttering one terrible word:</p>

<p>"Murder!"</p>

<p>The word struck her like a blow in the face, then pierced
like a dagger to her heart.</p>

<p>"Oh-h-h!" she gasped, throwing out her white, agonized
hands as if to ward off a stroke of fate.</p>

<p>The next moment her senses gave way before the shock.</p>

<p>She reeled blindly forward and fell like a log at the dastard's
feet.</p>

<p>This was what Jem Rhodes had hoped and expected.</p>

<p>With a laugh of demoniac satisfaction he lifted Geraldine
in his arms, and bore her to a second-class coach, having
bought tickets for this with a distinct purpose.</p>

<p>To his joy he found that he and Geraldine would be the
only passengers on this coach.</p>

<p>"The foul fiend helps me! I'll have a fair field for my
love-making," he thought, exultantly, as the train
steamed out from the station.</p>

<p>Presently Geraldine, whom he had lain back on her seat,
stirred and opened her eyes with a dazed look.</p>

<p>"Oh, what does this mean? Where am I?" she gasped.</p>

<p>Standish bent over her, and said, soothingly:</p>

<p>"Don't you remember, Miss Harding? I brought you
here to see Hawthorne. He will be here in a moment."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;the train is moving," she cried, in a frightened
voice.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he hissed, and suddenly Geraldine felt the cold
muzzle of a pistol pressed against her warm, white temple,
and a hoarse voice continued:</p>

<p>"You are at the mercy of a desperate man! Do not move
or speak, or I will blow your brains out and then leap from
the train in the darkness. I swear it. I have much to say
to you, and I shall say it with my finger on the trigger of
this pistol, ready to kill you if you utter one word without
my permission. Now the conductor is coming in to take
up our tickets. Do not dare to speak to him or show one
sign of excitement."</p>

<p>Life is sweet to the young and loving, and Geraldine
dared not disobey that hoarse command. She crouched,
trembling in her seat while the gruff conductor took up
the tickets and passed on to the next car.</p>

<p>They were again alone, and in a whirlwind of conflicting
emotions Geraldine waited for the next words of her companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>In his hoarse voice, vibrant with passion, she had suddenly
recognized Clifford Standish.</p>

<p>She comprehended that he had set a trap for her, and
that she had fallen into it. The horror of her thoughts no
pen could tell!</p>

<p>He bent toward her as he sat on the opposite seat, and
though her heart swelled with a terrible hate, she dared
not utter a word of remonstrance, for she saw that, half-hidden
by his coat-sleeve, he carried his deadly weapon
ready to wreak vengeance on her for the least disobedience.</p>

<p>But though she dared not speak, Geraldine could not restrain
the indignation that flashed upon him from her contemptuous
eyes, and surely that glance was enough to
wither him with its burning scorn.</p>

<p>But, unmoved by her wrath, Clifford Standish asked,
calmly:</p>

<p>"Have you recognized me yet, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>She nodded in silent, ineffable scorn, and he went on:</p>

<p>"I have much to tell you, and when I am done you will
not despise me as you do now, for I have been cruelly
wronged and defamed, just to gratify the spite of envious
people."</p>

<p>The dark, scornful eyes looked at him in silent amazement
as he went on:</p>

<p>"Geraldine, that arrest on the stage last night was simply
for the purpose of turning your heart against me.
Another man envied me, and concocted that villainous plot
to make you believe I was married, that he might win you
himself. I have no wife, nor ever shall have, unless you
will keep your promise to be mine."</p>

<p>His voice sank to the low, tremulous cadence that he
had found so effective on the stage, but the unchanging
scorn of the bright eyes assured him that she was not
moved by his ranting.</p>

<p>Heaving a deep sigh, he went on, passionately:</p>

<p>"It was a deep-laid scheme of that contemptible fireman,
that low fellow, to turn you against me. And you know I
had no time to explain anything to you. I was simply
dragged away like a dog! Well, when my case came up in
court this morning, the woman who had been hired to testify
against me broke down in the witness chair, and
owned that she did not even know me. Hawthorne had
bribed her, she said, to claim me for her husband. I was
discharged, as I told you last night that I would be to-day.
Had you not heard, Geraldine, of my discharge, cleared of
the foul imputation on my honor?" he demanded, anxiously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
wondering if her knowledge of the truth would
enable her to cast back the falsehood in his teeth.</p>

<p>But Geraldine had heard nothing, so, when he said
again, "Speak Geraldine, did you not know I was free?"
she answered, simply:</p>

<p>"No, I did not know it."</p>

<p>He breathed a sigh of relief at her ignorance of his escape,
and resumed his falsehoods with more self-confidence:</p>

<p>"I was free, but half broken-hearted over the thought of
the ignominy to which I had been subjected and the cruel
impression it had made on my betrothed bride."</p>

<p>He saw her shudder at the last two words, but he was
pitiless in his resolve to sacrifice her to his mad passion.</p>

<p>"Ah, Geraldine, was it not a fiendish act to turn your
heart against me like that?" he cried. "I left the court-house
and went to the hotel to see you. All the members
of the company received me joyfully, but they had cruel
news for me. They told me you had left them for Hawthorne&mdash;that
you were betrothed to him, and he had demanded
your retirement from the stage. Was this true,
Geraldine?"</p>

<p>She bowed a cold, affirmative answer.</p>

<p>"It was true! I knew it, and I was in despair," ranted
Standish. "Oh, how easily a woman's heart can turn
against a man! You might have waited a day, Geraldine,
and given me a chance to clear myself from that false
charge. But, no! in your wounded pride you turned
against me, and pledged yourself to the traitor who had
plotted that vile outrage&mdash;my arrest on the stage&mdash;to further
his own base ends."</p>

<p>She sat listening dumbly while the train rushed on and
on, bearing her farther and farther away from New York
and her own true lover&mdash;for she knew in her heart that he
was true, and that the actor was telling her vile falsehoods&mdash;and
her poor heart sank like a stone in her breast.</p>

<p>Oh, what would be her fate now, she wondered in anguish,
hating herself because she had fallen so easily into
this fatal trap.</p>

<p>Standish continued, in a pleading tone:</p>

<p>"What could I do in my despair, darling, but oppose
cunning to cunning, and fraud to fraud? I knew that if I
came to you in my own person, I should not even be allowed
to see you. My enemies would separate us, keep us
apart so that you should never know how cruelly I had
been wronged. So I planned to get you away from them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and into my power. I determined to have my promised
bride if I had to steal her away from our enemies. I
knew," eagerly, "that when you heard the truth, sweet
Geraldine, you would forgive me for this bold move, and
love me again. So&mdash;we are on our way now to Chicago,
and there you shall become my bride!"</p>

</div></div>


<p>Poor Geraldine! poor Geraldine! What a cruel ending
this was to the Christmas Day that had dawned so auspiciously
upon her life.</p>

<p>She had had a few hours of exquisite happiness&mdash;the
pure and perfect happiness of tender mutual love, that
brings heaven down to earth for young, ardent hearts.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">* * "That passionate love of youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i7">That comes but once in its perfect bliss&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">A love that, in spite of its trust and truth,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>From bliss to despair&mdash;that was the story of Geraldine's
one day.</p>

<p>But for the shining ring on her little hand she would
have believed it all a dream, so swiftly had the brightness
fled.</p>

<p>How she loathed and hated the smooth, smiling villain
before her, who, while pretending to love her, had
actually threatened her with death; who held at that moment,
under his hand, a deadly weapon with which to
compel her obedience.</p>

<p>The poor girl sat looking at him with angry tears in her
large brown eyes, her cheeks alternately red and pale
with the blood that rushed to and fro from her wildly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
throbbing heart. At one moment she would feel ill enough
to faint, the next her burning indignation would drive
away all weakness.</p>

<p>She did not believe one word of the smooth story he
had related to her, hoping that her girlish credulity would
accept it for truth.</p>

<p>And she was determined that she would die before she
would marry the wretch.</p>

<p>But how was she to escape if he stood guard over her
all the way to Chicago, with a deadly weapon in his hand?</p>

<p>If she shrieked out to the conductor for assistance, her
abductor would kill her on the spot.</p>

<p>It was a situation to blanch the bravest cheek, and Geraldine
was only a poor, weak girl. No wonder that the
blood ran cold in her veins with despair.</p>

<p>She could see nothing before her but death&mdash;certain
death at the hands of the desperate villain by her side.</p>

<p>For he was determined to marry her or kill her; and of
the two calamities she resolved to choose the last.</p>

<p>But&mdash;and a faint spark of hope came to her&mdash;if she could
only get him to leave her side a while, she might escape&mdash;might
jump from the flying train in the darkness.</p>

<p>He was watching her changing face with eager anxiety
as to what she was going to say to him now, and suddenly
he saw it brighten with a thought he could not fathom.</p>

<p>There had flashed over Geraldine a remembrance of his
last words:</p>

<p>"What could I do in my despair but oppose cunning to
cunning, and fraud to fraud?"</p>

<p>Her sombre eyes brightened as she thought:</p>

<p>"He has taught me a lesson that I will profit by. Perhaps
I can thus throw him off his guard."</p>

<p>Standish exclaimed, eagerly and curiously:</p>

<p>"What have you to say, Geraldine, to my story? Will
you accept it for the truth, and renew your faith in my
love and honor?"</p>

<p>Duplicity was a stranger to Geraldine's nature, and it
was hard indeed to act the part she was planning, but her
stage training enabled her to carry it off superbly.</p>

<p>Her lovely face softened inexpressibly, and she looked
up at him with a shy yet tender glance that thrilled him
with hope.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a strange story you have told me!" she twittered,
sweetly, and added: "How can you forgive me for
my unfaith?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Clifford Standish started with blended surprise and joy,
for he had not counted on such an easy victory.</p>

<p>He had expected that Geraldine would accuse him of
falsehood, scorn him, flout him&mdash;do anything else but
weaken in this simple way.</p>

<p>But his masculine vanity made the task of gulling him
an easy one, for he thought instantly:</p>

<p>"How weak and silly women are! They will believe any
garbled story a man chooses to tell them."</p>

<p>Aloud, he said, joyously:</p>

<p>"Then you believe me, Geraldine? They have not turned
your heart against me?"</p>

<p>She answered, with seemingly pretty penitence:</p>

<p>"At first they did&mdash;for&mdash;for it all seemed so real on the
stage last night&mdash;the arrest and all, you know. And I was
wild with pain and humiliation; so I let them persuade me
into anything. But, now that you have explained all to
me, I see it in a different light, for of course you would
not have wished to marry me if you had a wife already."</p>

<p>"Of course not," he echoed, smiling to himself at her
innocent ignorance.</p>

<p>"So," continued Geraldine, smiling also, but at his gullibility,
"you may put away your pistol, for it makes me
very nervous to see it. And you do not need to stand guard
over me, and I am ready to keep my promise to marry
you."</p>

<p>"Geraldine," he cried, transported with joy at her
sweetness, and bent to kiss her, but she repulsed him with
shy grace.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;wait till we are married, sir!"</p>

<p>"Very well, darling; but&mdash;will you promise me not to
speak to any one on the train but myself?" suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I promise you that," she answered, carelessly, hoping
that he would leave her, but it seemed that he had no such
amiable intention.</p>

<p>He removed the glasses under which he had posed as
Jem Rhodes, the better to feast his eyes on her peerless
beauty, and remained by her side, talking to her until she
was wild with disgust.</p>

<p>Yet she had to wear her brightest smile, and answer him
with seeming vivacity, to keep up the impression she had
made of satisfaction with her fate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the train rushed on to the first station and
passed it without interruption. Hawthorne's telegram had
not overtaken the fugitives. Poor Geraldine's fate was
sealed, and Standish was triumphant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish something would happen," she thought, desperately.
"I wish the train would get off the track and hurt
him, and nobody else, so that I might escape!"</p>

<p>How strangely our impetuous wishes are answered
sometimes.</p>

<p>Something did happen to Geraldine the very next moment.</p>

<p>The conductor came back from the Pullman coach, and,
pausing at her seat, said, respectfully:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, miss, but there is a lady back in the
Pullman whose husband has just died suddenly from a
frightful hemorrhage. In her distress there is not a woman
to comfort her except an unfeeling negro maid, who is too
busy flirting with the porter to attend to her duties.
Could you&mdash;would you go back in there and speak a word
of comfort to the poor soul?"</p>

<p>His gruff voice was very kindly now that his sympathies
were awakened, and he gazed almost pleadingly at the girl
who looked, in turn, questioningly at Standish.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, as if about to refuse, then answered,
quietly:</p>

<p>"Yes, go, and I will accompany you," and, like a jailer
guarding a prisoner, he followed her to the Pullman coach.</p>

<p>The newly made widow leaned against the berth where
the dead man lay with his face hidden beneath the sheet,
her face in her hands, sobbing in a subdued but heart-broken
way. None of the other berths had been made up
yet, and the few men in the car looked solemn and ill at
ease. A gayly dressed mulatto woman, evidently the
lady's maid, was whispering to the smart yellow porter.</p>

<p>Geraldine paused by the weeping woman with a timid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
glance that took in every detail of her appearance&mdash;the
elegant curves of the stately figure in a fine cloth traveling
gown, the glint of golden hair beneath the dark, close
hat, the glittering rings on the hands that held the handkerchief
to her face.</p>

<p>She whispered, shyly, to Standish:</p>

<p>"She is one of those grand aristocrats that I used to see
at O'Neill's store. I'm afraid to speak to her. Some of
them are so proud, so haughty, they can wither you with
a look."</p>

<p>"Suppose we go back, then, to our seats," he returned,
eagerly.</p>

<p>But something held Geraldine by the mourner's side, in
spite of her terror of proud, rich women; and as a sudden
low sob broke on the air, she started hurriedly forward
with a gentle touch on the lady's arm, bending her face
down to whisper, brokenly, out of the wealth of her sympathy:</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so sorry for you, I am so sorry for you! May
God help you to bear it!"</p>

<p>The mourner lifted up a lovely face framed in golden
hair&mdash;the face of a woman somewhere between thirty and
forty&mdash;and met the glance of those sweet brown eyes
swimming in sympathetic tears, and her heart seemed to
answer the girl's words. With another heart-breaking sob,
she dropped her face against Geraldine's shoulder, and let
the girlish arms infold her like a daughter's clasp.</p>

<p>"Come away to a seat," she whispered, and led her away
some distance from the berth.</p>

<p>Sitting side by side, they mingled their tears together,
for it seemed to Geraldine as if she could feel, by some
divine instinct, all the force of the other woman's grief.</p>

<p>"For what, if I were married to my darling Harry, and
Death took him&mdash;oh, it would break my heart!" she
thought, wildly.</p>

<p>Standish had followed and taken a seat just behind her,
where he could listen to every word that passed.</p>

<p>Oh, how she hated him for his dastardly espionage, but
she dared not openly revolt. She bided her time.</p>

<p>She felt with a keen thrill of pleasure how the strange
lady clung to her in the abandonment of her grief, nestling
her weary head so confidingly against her shoulder, and
letting her arm rest around the girl's waist.</p>

<p>"Tell me if there is anything I can do for you," she
whispered, kindly, and the mourner hushed her sobs and
murmured:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell the conductor to make arrangements to take&mdash;take&mdash;my
poor husband through to Chicago, our home."</p>

<p>Standish beckoned the conductor back to the seat, and
there was a colloquy for some time over mournful details.
When he went away, the lady who had grown calmer,
lifted her tearful face, and looked at Geraldine, eagerly,
tenderly.</p>

<p>"Who are you, child, with that voice and face from the
haunting past? What is your name?"</p>

<p>"I am Geraldine Harding!"</p>

<p>"Geraldine Harding! Oh, Heaven!" springing to her
feet in strange excitement, her blue eyes glittering through
their tears.</p>

<p>Geraldine did not know what to make of her strange excitement,
so she waited, mutely, while the lady went on,
breathlessly:</p>

<p>"Where did you live?&mdash;oh, I mean, tell me all about
yourself! Oh, I am in such trouble that I cannot express
myself clearly! I mean no impertinence, but I am terribly
interested in you and in your past."</p>

<p>"There is not much in my past that could interest you,
dear madame&mdash;only the simple story of a poor country girl
who came to New York, with another girl, to earn her
own living," Geraldine said, modestly.</p>

<p>"So young, so lovely! Yet thrown on the world to earn
her bread!" murmured the lady, tearfully. She caught the
girl's hand, holding it tightly as she continued: "Your
parents, dear? Why did they let you leave them?"</p>

<p>"I was an orphan, madame."</p>

<p>"An orphan! Where was your home?"</p>

<p>"I lived in the country near New York, with a farmer,
to whom my father took me when I was a delicate child.
The farmer's name was Newell, and his wife, Malinda, had
formerly been a servant to my mother. She gave me tender,
motherly care, and raised me from a frail child to a
robust girl. My father sent money for a while, then he
died, and left me dependent on those people. They were
poor and had a hard struggle to get along with their large
brood of children, so I&mdash;I&mdash;wearied of the life, and ran
away to seek my fortune in the great city."</p>

<p>"And your mother, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"My father said that she was dead," she replied, simply.</p>

<p>"It was false! He, your cruel father, took you from me!
I am your own mother, darling!" cried the lady, extending
imploring arms.</p>

<p>Clifford Standish watched the scene before him with
eager interest.</p>

<p>It was like the plot of a play, this touching union of a
long parted mother and child.</p>

<p>In watching the interesting scene he forgot for a moment
how it might affect his own interests.</p>

<p>The beautiful, sorrowful widow, with tears streaming
down her pale cheeks, extended her arms to Geraldine, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"I am your own mother, my darling!"</p>

<p>Startling and surprising as this statement was to Geraldine,
not a doubt of its truth entered the girl's mind.</p>

<p>On the contrary, her heart leaped with joy, for she had
already felt herself drawn with inexplicable tenderness to
the speaker.</p>

<p>And the moment that she held out her arms to Geraldine
the girl sprang into them gladly, and the next moment
they were embracing each other with ineffable tenderness,
the grief of the widow comforted in a measure by the restoration
of her daughter.</p>

<p>Clifford Standish looking on, suddenly felt a touch of
uneasiness, and muttered, under his breath:</p>

<p>"Confound the luck! I wish she had not met this woman
until after we were married."</p>

<p>And thinking it was time for him to assert his claim, he
waited until the mother and daughter withdrew from each
other's arms, and said, respectfully:</p>

<p>"Accept my congratulations, madame, on the finding of
your beautiful daughter, my promised wife!"</p>

<p>The lady, with a quick start of surprise, as if she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
but that moment become aware of his presence, turned and
looked at the speaker.</p>

<p>His words had fallen like hail-stones on her heart.</p>

<p>She was one of the proudest women on earth, and her
large dark eyes scanned Clifford Standish with cold inquiry.</p>

<p>He had just announced himself as the betrothed of her
daughter, and the cold glance of her eyes asked distinctly
if he were worthy of that honor.</p>

<p>There was a moment of breathless silence, and the actor
looked at Geraldine with eyes whose veiled menace defied
her to deny his claim. She, remembering his deadly
threats, paled and shuddered.</p>

<p>She could not afford to anger him yet. She realized that
fully.</p>

<p>The lady, after transfixing the daring actor with one
steely glance, looked at her daughter.</p>

<p>"Is this true?" she asked, in displeased surprise.</p>

<p>"It is true," faltered Geraldine, without daring to look
up; and again Standish, encouraged by success, interposed:</p>

<p>"Let me explain the case to you, madame. We have been
engaged to marry for some time, and we are now on our
wedding journey&mdash;that is, we are to be married as soon as
we reach Chicago."</p>

<p>The lady, still icily ignoring her daughter's suitor, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Can this be true, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>The young girl answered again, dejectedly.</p>

<p>"It is true."</p>

<p>Standish beamed upon her gratefully, joyously, hoping
from her acquiescence that he had indeed made some impression
on her heart.</p>

<p>But the mother was wearing her most frigid air as she
remarked:</p>

<p>"This is a rather unusual proceeding. Should not the
marriage have preceded instead of following the wedding
journey?"</p>

<p>Standish answered, quickly:</p>

<p>"That is the usual way, certainly, but this was an elopement."</p>

<p>"An elopement?" cried the lady, with rising indignation;
but Geraldine laid a pleading hand upon her arm,
crying:</p>

<p>"Mother, dear mother, let us discuss this question later.
At present let me present Mr. Standish to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother bowed with cold courtesy. She evidently did
not approve of her daughter's suitor.</p>

<p>Standish read her mind like an open book.</p>

<p>He comprehended that she was proud and rich, and
would scout the idea of her daughter's marriage with one
beneath her in social position.</p>

<p>Yet he was all the more determined to make her his
own.</p>

<p>Bending down to Geraldine, he whispered, hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Let me speak to you alone."</p>

<p>She withdrew with him to a little distance, and he whispered,
sternly:</p>

<p>"Do not forgot that I have sworn that you shall marry
me, or become the bride of Death."</p>

<p>"I will remember," she faltered, and he added:</p>

<p>"The discovery of your mother makes no difference in
your promise to me. She must not refuse your hand to
me."</p>

<p>Geraldine saw that he was in a desperate mood, and she
did not care to offend him; but her heart was throbbing
joyfully in her breast, for she knew that heaven itself
would come to her aid, and that she would surely outwit
him at last.</p>

<p>But she said, with quiet dignity:</p>

<p>"Mr. Standish, it would seem as if common decency required
the postponement of this subject until after my
mother has buried her dead."</p>

<p>"You are trying to escape me!" he exclaimed, warningly;
but he saw by her indignant look that he was presuming
too far, for she said, quickly:</p>

<p>"This harshness will not further your cause with me,
sir. You cannot marry me by brute force."</p>

<p>"That is true; but I have your promise."</p>

<p>"Extorted from me under menace of death!" she returned,
indignation getting the better of her calmness.</p>

<p>"Oh, Geraldine, cannot you forgive the madness of a
love like mine that dares anything rather than lose you?"
he implored, with theatrical fervor.</p>

<p>"Geraldine, dear," called her mother, softly, and she
darted back to her side.</p>

<p>The lady said, quickly:</p>

<p>"My dear daughter, I can never give my consent to your
marriage with that person."</p>

<p>Geraldine threw her arms about the lady, and whispered,
thrillingly:</p>

<p>"Dear mother, I do not wish to marry him; but&mdash;let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
wait until after we reach Chicago before we repudiate my
promise. I fear his anger, for he is a desperate man. Let
us temporize with him until we are out of his power."</p>

<p>By that time Standish had returned to his seat, and seeing
that the proud mother of Geraldine was determined to
ignore him, his anger made him say, sullenly:</p>

<p>"Madame, you have asserted a claim to Miss Harding, as
your daughter, but you have presented no proofs to substantiate
your claim. As her present guardian and her betrothed
husband, I must request the production of those
proofs."</p>

<p>She gazed at him in cold astonishment at this audacity,
but answered, frigidly:</p>

<p>"Your solicitude does you credit, but I can satisfy all
your doubts."</p>

<p>Beckoning the conductor, who was passing through the
car, she said, quietly:</p>

<p>"Kindly tell this person my name and standing."</p>

<p>Standish winced under the contemptuous epithet, "person,"
and glared at the conductor, who turned to him and
said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. A. T. Fitzgerald, formerly of New York, now of
Chicago, was the wife, now the widow, of A. T. Fitzgerald,
the foremost banker and capitalist of Chicago."</p>

<p>Standish bowed without a word. He saw the impassable
gulf of wealth and social position yawning between him
and pretty Geraldine, but he swore to himself that he
would not give her up.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald thanked the conductor, and added:</p>

<p>"No doubt you are familiar with the circumstances of
my first marriage, and&mdash;divorce. Kindly tell him these
also."</p>

<p>The conductor looked embarrassed, but she smiled at
him encouragingly, and said:</p>

<p>"Do as I ask you, please. It is indeed a favor."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fitzgerald's first husband was Howard Harding,
of New York, from whom she obtained a divorce ten or
eleven years ago."</p>

<p>"State the cause," broke in Mrs. Fitzgerald's clear voice,
and the conductor, who was fully conversant with this
scandal in high life, added:</p>

<p>"Howard Harding led a gay life, and deserted Mrs.
Harding for a notorious Parisian of the demi-monde. His
wife secured a divorce, and in about two years married
Mr. Fitzgerald, of Chicago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the custody of their only child, little Geraldine,
was given&mdash;&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"To the mother, of course," ended the conductor.</p>

<p>"Yes, and within a year she was stolen from her by the
guilty father and hidden from her so securely that she
never found her again until to-night," cried the lady, her
eyes resting tenderly on the face of her lovely child.</p>

<p>"Is it so indeed? Let me congratulate you most heartily,
madame," exclaimed the conductor, his eyes resting admiringly
on Geraldine, while he added: "The likeness between
you is most startling."</p>

<p>"And, oh, mother, dear mother, it was this kind gentleman
who came to me in another coach and begged me to
come and comfort you in your sorrow. But for him we
might never have found each other," cried Geraldine, in
boundless gratitude, for she felt that not only had he restored
her to her mother's arms, but he had also delivered
her from the power of her desperate lover.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald, who had been so frigid to Standish, unbent
from her haughty mien and wept tears of gratitude
as she wrung the hand of the conductor.</p>

<p>"Oh, Captain Stevens, as kind as you have always been
to me on my journeys on your train, I never knew your
true worth till now, but ere long you shall receive ample
evidence of my gratitude," she assured him.</p>

<p>The conductor was very proud and happy over his
agency in restoring Geraldine to her mother's arms, but
while he was declining her promised reward, he was called
away, and then Mrs. Fitzgerald turned again to her daughter's
suitor.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied with my proofs?" she demanded, icily.</p>

<p>"Perfectly, madame, and I hope you will permit me to
express my joy at your reunion with your daughter."</p>

<p>"I thank you, and I have a request to make of you. I
wish to be left alone with my daughter at present. Will
you kindly respect this desire, and call on me later in Chicago,
where I will consider your claims for my Geraldine's
hand?" said Mrs. Fitzgerald, presenting him with a card
on which was engraved her address on Prairie avenue.</p>

<p>Thus coolly dismissed, and not daring to protest against
the authority of the haughty lady, Standish bowed and
withdrew to another seat in the same coach, where he
covertly watched them without daring to intrude his hated
presence on them.</p>

<p>"Ah my darling, how strangely all this has happened!"
cried the lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"How strangely and how fortunately!" echoed Geraldine,
gladly.</p>

<p>"But, oh, how sad that it did not happen sooner&mdash;before
my darling husband died! Oh, how he would have loved
you for my sake, Geraldine; for he was so good to me, he
made me so happy, that no grief remained in my heart for
that false one who deserted me for a wicked woman, and
then stole you away from me!" cried her mother, her
mournful thoughts reverting to that loved lost one whose
pulseless form had now been conveyed to another coach
to be made ready for its last long sleep.</p>

<p>"Oh, my mother, how can I comfort you for your sad
loss?" cried Geraldine, tenderly.</p>

<p>"You can love me, darling, and try to fill the void left
by his loss. Oh, I hope that his kind spirit hovers near and
knows that I have found you, my dear, for we have wished
for this so often, and he has spent many thousands of dollars
trying to trace you for me, but all in vain. For all
our efforts were made abroad, in the belief that your
father had taken you away with him. I could not conceive
of his taking you away and then deserting you so heartlessly.
But doubtless that wicked woman induced him to
do it. Such women have great influence over weak-minded
men. But let us try to forgive him the wrongs we suffered
at his hands now that he is dead," ended Mrs. Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>How bitter was the disappointment of Harry Hawthorne
on reaching the first station on his route in following the
fugitives to find that his telegram had not been received
until the Pennsylvania Limited had thundered past with
the triumphant actor and his helpless victim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>His heart sank at the first moment with a terrible despair,
but hope quickly reasserted itself.</p>

<p>"I will follow them!" he exclaimed, determined to
leave no effort untried to rescue his heart's darling.</p>

<p>But the train with the fugitives was two hours ahead of
the desperate lover, and long ere he reached Chicago the
objects of his pursuit were at their destination&mdash;Standish
in a second-rate lodging-house, Geraldine, with her
mother, at her magnificent home on Prairie avenue, which
holds to Chicago the rank of Fifth avenue to New York.</p>

<p>To Geraldine it was a wonderful transition, this change
from the simple life of a working-girl in New York to this
palatial home, where obsequious servants sprang to gratify
her slightest wish, and where a devoted mother found time
even in the anguish of widowhood to lavish on her the
fondest love and care.</p>

<p>And in that home she had found another charming surprise&mdash;a
dear little half-brother and sister, the children of
her mother's second marriage&mdash;Earl, a beautiful, manly
boy of ten, and Claire, a lovely fairy of seven years.</p>

<p>These two children had been left at home with their
governess while their parents made a hurried business
trip to New York&mdash;the trip that had ended so disastrously
to the father, who had been in declining health for several
years.</p>

<p>Bitter was the grief of the little ones when called to
gaze for the last time on his beloved face, and Geraldine's
tears mingled with theirs, for she knew that had he lived
he must have proved to her a tenderer parent than the
heartless father who had deserted her mother and then
stolen her child and left her to grow up in poverty and
heart-loneliness.</p>

<p>The second day after their arrival in Chicago the sacred
remains of the beloved dead were taken to a crematory,
and reduced to ashes, in accordance with the will of the
deceased.</p>

<p>But the wife to whom he had been so kind and devoted
could not bear to consign his remains to kindred dust.</p>

<p>She had the precious ashes sealed in a beautiful box of
wrought silver and gold studded with precious jewels, and
kept this box in her own apartments, a sacred treasure,
dear to her for its precious memories.</p>

<p>When all these solemn ceremonies were over, the mother
was ready to hear the story that Geraldine was waiting to
pour into her ears.</p>

<p>A note from Clifford Standish arrived the morning after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Mr. Fitzgerald's cremation, asking when he might call on
Geraldine.</p>

<p>She went with the note to her mother and begged pardon
for intruding on her sacred grief with her own
troubles.</p>

<p>"Sit down, my darling, and tell me all," was the gentle
reply.</p>

<p>When she had learned the story of Geraldine's persecution
by the actor, her indignation was beyond measure.</p>

<p>"He shall be sent to prison for this outrage!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Is that necessary?" Geraldine asked, timidly.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you wish to spare him, darling?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if we can get rid of his pretensions to my hand
without resorting to extreme measures."</p>

<p>"You shrink from notoriety. I understand, and will try
to indulge your wishes, although the wretch ought to be
punished to the full extent of the law for his villainous
conduct," exclaimed the lady, adding, fearfully:</p>

<p>"Only think what might have been your fate, dear, but
for the accident that threw us together on the train."</p>

<p>Geraldine shuddered as she recalled the peril from which
she had been delivered, then said, with infinite relief:</p>

<p>"But I am out of his power now, and I need not even
see him again, I hope."</p>

<p>"No, it will not be necessary; for although you may
grant him liberty to call this evening, I will be the one to
receive him and settle his pretensions," replied the lady,
decidedly.</p>

<p>While she was speaking her eyes fell on the dimpled
white hands of Geraldine, and she saw for the first time
that the young girl was wearing a superb diamond ring.</p>

<p>"If that is Mr. Standish's property, you had better let
me return it to him," she remarked.</p>

<p>She was surprised at the warm blush that overspread
the fair young face.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it&mdash;is my engagement-ring, mamma," she said,
shyly.</p>

<p>"Given to you by that wretch! Then of course you do
not wish to keep it. You shall have all the diamonds you
wish now, my dear one."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my precious mamma, for your generous
promise. I adore diamonds, and shall enjoy possessing
plenty of them, but with this one I would not part for a
queen's ransom!" exclaimed pretty Geraldine, pressing
her lips fondly to the shining ring on her fair hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald could not repress her rising displeasure.</p>

<p>"Indeed, my dear, I am surprised at you. I shall have
to insist on your returning that person's ring," she said,
gravely.</p>

<p>Geraldine looked up with a lovely smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, you cannot think this ring was given to
me by Clifford Standish? Oh, no; it was the gift of a lover
I left behind me in New York&mdash;my promised husband,
the noblest lover any girl ever had!" she breathed, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Geraldine!"</p>

<p>Surprise and disapproval breathed in the lady's voice.</p>

<p>"May I tell you all about him, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I'm anxious to hear. And, by the way, are these
two the only ones to whom you have promised your hand,
or have you any more disclosures to make in that line?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, are you offended with me?" exclaimed
Geraldine, alarmed at the sarcastic coldness of her
mother's voice.</p>

<p>"I am only surprised, my dear. Go on with your story,"
Mrs. Fitzgerald returned, quietly.</p>

<p>And, curbing her impatience and disapproval under a
mask of calmness, she listened eagerly to Geraldine's
story of her love for Harry Hawthorne.</p>

<p>And she thought she had never realized how radiantly
lovely her daughter was until now, when her praises of
her handsome betrothed brought the bright blushes to her
cheeks, and the softened brightness to her starry brown
eyes.</p>

<p>She did not interrupt her story by a word, but she listened
in the deepest gravity until Geraldine had finished;
then she kissed her tenderly and said:</p>

<p>"My dear, I can never consent to your marriage with
Mr. Hawthorne."</p>

<p>"Mamma!" in alarm.</p>

<p>"It was well enough, my child, for the poor shop-girl of
New York to be engaged to the brave young fireman, of
course. But circumstances alter cases. Do you not understand
that, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>Geraldine was terribly alarmed and frightened by the
words and looks of her proud, rich mother.</p>

<p>She faltered, imploringly:</p>

<p>"Mamma, I am afraid to try to understand you, for&mdash;it
would kill me to give up my love, Harry."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it would not, dear, for you will soon forget
your poor lover in the new sphere of life you will now fill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
He is no longer a proper mate for you. Let him marry
your sweet friend, Cissy, who is more suited to him in social
station than my daughter an heiress."</p>

<p>"Mamma, you are surely jesting with me! You do not
really believe that I would throw over my noble lover!
Why, it would break my heart to lose him, and if he married
Cissy I should hate her till my dying day!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my dear! you will soon forget him, and the
match must surely be broken off, for I may as well tell
you now that almost in your cradle you were betrothed to
another&mdash;the son of a very dear friend of mine. So now
that I have found you, dear, you will belong to that other
one."</p>

<p>"Mamma, you are cruel, heartless! I cannot yield to you
in this, fondly as I love you."</p>

<p>"You would not surely defy my authority, Geraldine,
when I command you to write to Mr. Hawthorne, returning
his ring, and breaking the engagement!"</p>

<p>They gazed fixedly at each other, and Geraldine said,
imploringly:</p>

<p>"Mamma, I wrote to Harry yesterday, telling him all
that had happened to me, and promising to be true to him
through everything."</p>

<p>"You were a rash girl to act without consulting me in
the matter. But we will not discuss the subject any further
at present. Go now, and send the note to Standish,
giving him permission to call this evening," Mrs. Fitzgerald
answered, with an air of bitter displeasure.</p>

<p>Geraldine hastened to her room and scrawled a hasty
line to Clifford Standish:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may call at eight o'clock this evening."</p>

<p>When she had dispatched the note by a servant, she
threw herself, weeping, on a sofa.</p>

<p>Her fond heart was almost broken by her mother's command
to give up her lover.</p>

<p>"I will not obey her, for she has no right to demand such
a sacrifice from me!" she sobbed, resentfully.</p>

<p>It was true that she had already written to Hawthorne,
telling him all that had happened to her since she had seen
him last, and adding that no change of fortune could turn
her heart from its love. She had begged him to answer her
letter as soon as received, and added a postscript to ask him
to go and tell Cissy Carroll what she had written.</p>

<p>But an adverse fate seemed always to come between
Geraldine and her heart's choice.</p>

<p>Hawthorne, who was in Chicago by this time, vainly
seeking his lost love, was fated not to receive the letter.</p>

<p>But Clifford Standish, writhing with impatience over
the uncertainty that attended his love affair, was elated at
the reception of Geraldine's note permitting him to call.</p>

<p>When the time approached, he laid aside the clumsy disguise
he had assumed, and clothed himself in "purple and
fine linen," as the saying goes, hoping to make some impression
on the girl's proud mother by his handsome person
and stately manners. He remembered how contemptuously
she had called him "that person," and flattered
himself that she could not deny him the title of a gentleman
now.</p>

<p>Promptly at the time appointed he presented himself at
the splendid Fitzgerald mansion, and was ushered into a
luxurious little reception-room, where he waited in solitude
some time after sending his card to the ladies.</p>

<p>He smiled to himself, as he thought:</p>

<p>"Geraldine is probably adorning herself in all the splendors
of her newly acquired wealth to startle me with her
beauty. She will burst upon me presently in gorgeous
array, rustling in silk, and loaded with jewels, with all
the purse-proud vulgarity of the <i>nouveaux riche</i>."</p>

<p>And he did not reflect that he himself, following the
"loud" taste of many actors, was almost too stunningly
dressed for gentlemanly effect.</p>

<p>But just as he began to grow decidedly impatient at the
long delay, a handsome young woman came softly through
the draped door, and, advancing toward him, said, courteously:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fitzgerald desires that you will excuse her delay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
coming in. She has been detained by an unexpected caller,
but will be with you in a few minutes now."</p>

<p>He sprang excitedly to his feet.</p>

<p>"Azuba!" burst from his lips.</p>

<p>The handsome young woman, who had scarcely looked
at him before, turned her eyes toward him at that cry,
and recoiled with a stifled shriek of unutterable dismay.</p>

<p>Clifford Standish came close up to her, muttering:</p>

<p>"Azuba, what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>The woman's face became death-white with sudden fear,
and lifting her hand warningly, she almost, hissed:</p>

<p>"Hush! breathe not that name beneath this roof! It is
not my name now!"</p>

<p>"Another alias, then," he muttered. "What is it now?"</p>

<p>Her reply came with a groan:</p>

<p>"What does that matter to you? I am done with you and
the past forever&mdash;I am trying to lead an honest life and
earn an honest, respectable living. For Heaven's sake, do
not betray me to these people!"</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I am governess to Mrs. Fitzgerald's children. I am
trusted and liked by the whole family, and I try to deserve
it. Will you go away, and leave me in peace to my new
life?" she prayed, with clasped hands, her large blue eyes
swimming in frightened, beseeching tears.</p>

<p>"I have no wish to trouble you, Azuba&mdash;&mdash; Oh, pardon,
that name was a slip of the tongue! What do you call
yourself now?"</p>

<p>"Simply Kate Erroll&mdash;Miss Erroll to all. I have a right
to that name. It was my mother's before she was married.
But I cannot stay to talk to you now. I must go; but keep
my secret, will you, Clifford Standish?"</p>

<p>"What if I refuse?" he demanded, and she answered,
quickly:</p>

<p>"You could not injure me without bringing down harm
upon yourself;" and with that vague threat the handsome
governess fled by another door just as Mrs. Fitzgerald entered,
a sombre object in the long, trailing black robes of
widowhood.</p>

<p>She bowed to him with a sort of cold expectancy. Calling
all his native effrontery to his aid, he rose, and said, theatrically:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fitzgerald, I have come to plead with you to
sanction my engagement to your daughter, Geraldine. We
love each other devotedly, and it would break our loving
hearts to be separated. You may think, perhaps, that I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
no mate for your daughter, because you are rich; but that
is a great mistake. I am an actor, I own, but I am paid a
magnificent salary. My mother is very rich, and makes me
a handsome allowance. At her death&mdash;and she cannot live
much longer, being quite old and frail&mdash;I shall inherit her
large fortune and can support my wife in grand style."</p>

<p>Clifford Standish paused to note the effect of his boasting
on Mrs. Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>Every statement he had made was a falsehood, but he
knew that she could not disprove a single one.</p>

<p>The magnificent salary of which he boasted was only
fifty dollars a week, and as for his rich mother who made
him such a handsome allowance, and would leave him a
fortune when she died, the old woman was as poor as poverty
itself, and took in washing. But as she lived away off
in Colorado, he was not afraid that she would ever appear
to contradict his statement. In fact, he had told the same
story to every new acquaintance, until he had almost come
to believe it himself.</p>

<p>He judged that Mrs. Fitzgerald was proud and arrogant,
and would prefer her daughter to marry rich; so, after
telling his boastful story, he waited with some confidence
for her reply.</p>

<p>She drew herself erect to her stateliest height, and if
scorn could have killed, the lightnings of her dark eyes
would have stretched him dead at her aristocratic feet.</p>

<p>"You contemptible villain!" she exclaimed, angrily.</p>

<p>"Madame!"</p>

<p>"You perjured wretch! You cowardly wife-deserter! You
escaped criminal! You persecutor of innocence! You&mdash;you&mdash;fiend!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
concluded Mrs. Fitzgerald, losing her temper in
her righteous indignation and piling opprobrious epithets
one upon another in the white heat of her wrath.</p>

<p>Startled, cowed by this most unexpected onslaught, the
wretch could only cower in pallid amazement before the
lady as she continued her scathing denunciation.</p>

<p>"How dare you intrude yourself here after your vile
persecutions of Geraldine? Your audacity is startling, and
I should do quite right to hand you over to the police on
the charge of abducting and intimidating an innocent
young girl! But I abhor scandal, and for this reason I shall
not have you punished, unless&mdash;you dare to annoy us
again!"</p>

<p>Recovering his hardihood, he muttered, sullenly:</p>

<p>"Madame, I deny the truth of your statements. Your
daughter promised to marry me!"</p>

<p>"At the point of a revolver, yes, when, fearing for her
life, she determined to temporize with you, hoping to
throw you off your guard that she might escape your cowardly
persecution. She has told me her story from beginning
to end, and I shudder to think what might have been
my dear girl's fate but for our meeting on the train!" exclaimed
Mrs. Fitzgerald, flashing on him the scornful lightnings
of her reproachful eyes.</p>

<p>Realizing for the first time that Geraldine had duped
him in her apparent acquiescence to his will, and feeling
himself beaten for the time in the dangerous game he had
played, he cowered sullenly before her as she pointed to
the door, saying, authoritatively:</p>

<p>"Now go, you hound! and never let me see your craven
face again!"</p>

<p>Defeated, humiliated, writhing under her womanly
scorn, he slunk out of the room and from her presence,
into the wintry streets whose chill he could not feel,
so hotly was he raging in his inmost heart against the two
women who had scorned him for his wickedness.</p>

<p>"So you were playing on my credulity, laughing at me
in your sleeve, pretty Geraldine!" he muttered, with a
stifled oath. "Very well. You defeated me this time, but&mdash;look
to yourself in the future!"</p>

<p>So muttering, he turned toward the sleigh that he had
left waiting for him, but, to his surprise, it was gone.</p>

<p>For some unknown reason the driver had proved false to
his engagement, and deserted his post.</p>

<p>Cursing the man's stupidity, he walked some distance
along the snowy streets in the piercing cold of the western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
air before he boarded a car to take him to his boarding-house
on State street.</p>

<p>Leaving the car, however, at an obscure side street with
the intention of seeking a near-by saloon and concert hall,
he crossed the street, and was proceeding on his way when
suddenly he heard hurried footsteps behind, and then a
hand clutched his arm whirling him fiercely around.</p>

<p>"Wretch!" hissed a man's voice, vibrant with hate.
"Wretch! So I have caught you at last! Where is she?
Where is my Geraldine?"</p>

<p>Under the glare of the electric lights that shone with
ghastly whiteness on the snowy pavement, he found himself
looking into the stern blue eyes of Harry Hawthorne.</p>

<p>For two days the young man had been on his track,
without one clew to reward his efforts, for the villain,
hiding his identity under an assumed name, had been
swallowed up, like a wave breaking on the shore, in the
vast city of Chicago.</p>

<p>Now, by chance, they were face to face, on an obscure
street, almost deserted by reason of the piercing cold, and
they looked at each other with mortal hate in their flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>"Where is she? Where is my Geraldine?" demanded
Hawthorne, hoarsely, tightening his grip on his enemy's
arm so that he vainly tried to throw it off.</p>

<p>Standish looked at him a moment in fear and indecision
then a devilish thought came to him, and he laughed
aloud, mockingly.</p>

<p>"Your Geraldine, ha! ha! Your Geraldine!"</p>

<p>Something in his voice and laughter seemed to freeze
the blood in Hawthorne's veins, but he said, in deadly
wrath:</p>

<p>"You stole her from me by a vile trick. I saw the forged
note you sent to her, and I know that you have betrayed
her to some terrible fate; but by the God above us, if she
has suffered wrong at your hands, Standish, your vile life
shall pay the forfeit!"</p>

<p>"Bah! Hawthorne, this ranting is useless. She is alive,
she is well, she is happy, and I have just come from keeping
an appointment with the charming little beauty."</p>

<p>"Liar!"</p>

<p>"Do not bandy epithets so generously, Hawthorne. We
really have no quarrel with each other&mdash;for she isn't worth
it!"</p>

<p>"Liar! Hound!" and Hawthorne looked as if he could
barely restrain himself from throttling his defiant foe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>But Standish kept his temper well in check, knowing
that he could gain more thus than by losing it.</p>

<p>He smiled mockingly, and said:</p>

<p>"Those are hard words, but I think you will offer an
apology for them presently. See! here is Geraldine's note
to me. It is yours if you wish to keep it."</p>

<p>He thrust a crumpled sheet of paper into Hawthorne's
hand, and by the glaring electric light he read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Standish</span>:&mdash;You may call at eight o'clock this
evening.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geraldine Harding.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Dec. 29th, 1894."</p></blockquote>

<p>How the words glared up at him, for he knew the
writing well, and a groan burst from his lips as he flung
it from him, crying:</p>

<p>"Where is she? I must see her! I must have an explanation!"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you where she is. She would not wish it.
You may as well give up the game, Hawthorne, for I have
won!"</p>

<p>The triumph in his voice was hateful.</p>

<p>Hawthorne did not speak for a moment, and his opponent
continued:</p>

<p>"Let us understand each other. We have been rivals for
Geraldine Harding's love, and she has coquetted with us
both, promised her hand to both. Well, all is fair in love
or war. My little scheme succeeded, and she is satisfied!"</p>

<p>"You have married her, Standish?"</p>

<p>"How could I when I have a wife living in New York,
and Geraldine knows it? But I tell you she loves me and
is satisfied. We stage people are not at all prudish, you
know."</p>

<p>The next moment Hawthorne's strong fingers were
about his throat.</p>

<p>"You have lied, you miserable dastard! Geraldine is as
pure as snow, and unless you take back your falsehoods I
will strangle them in your throat!"</p>

<p>A hoarse, gurgling laugh issued from the convulsed
throat of Standish, and the next moment they closed in
deadly combat.</p>

<p>Both were strong and athletic men, both brave, both
desperate, and for a few minutes the contest they waged
was an equal one.</p>

<p>But suddenly Hawthorne began to get the advantage.</p>

<p>He had his foe down and his knee on his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you take back your foul lie, hound?" he hissed,
fiercely.</p>

<p>Standish made no answer in words.</p>

<p>He had been struggling all the while to get at his hip-pocket,
and now he succeeded in drawing out a dagger and
plunging it in Hawthorne's breast. There was a horrible
ripping sound, and he rolled over bleeding in the snow.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Fitzgerald had dismissed Standish, she returned
to her daughter and recounted all that had passed.</p>

<p>She was vastly amused at the actor's boastfulness, and
said:</p>

<p>"It is only low-bred people, 'beggars on horseback,' as
the saying goes, who brag of their possessions or their expectations.
Really high-toned people&mdash;and they may be
high-toned even if poor&mdash;can never tolerate purse-proud
vulgarity."</p>

<p>Geraldine laughed and said:</p>

<p>"Clifford Standish's story of his rich mother has always
been his trump card in social life. I have often been
secretly disgusted at hearing him tell it to new acquaintances."</p>

<p>"He probably sets a very low estimate on his own merits
when he has to resort to such silly boasting to curry favor,"
returned her mother, adding: "I have met people of
his stamp before, and, as a rule, their statements were untruthful.
I dare say, if the facts were known, the fellow's
mother takes in washing or goes out scrubbing."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, I am rid of him at last! I do not believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
he will ever dare to cross my path again since finding
out that I have such a strong defender in my noble
mother," declared Geraldine, gladly, for she did not yet
comprehend with what an evil nature she had to deal.</p>

<p>Believing herself rid of Clifford Standish forever, her
longing thoughts returned to the true lover from whom
she had been so cruelly torn.</p>

<p>"Oh, my love! my love! I cannot give you up," she
thought, tenderly, and after a moment's hesitancy she
cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, you said just now that a person may be
high-toned even though poor, and it made me think of my
lover Harry. If you should meet him, mamma, not knowing
his obscure station, you would think him not less than
princely. He has the bearing, the speech, and the heart
of a gentleman&mdash;of one of nature's noblemen. Then why
should you despise him for his poverty?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald's fair brow clouded with annoyance at
her daughter's words and she said, quickly:</p>

<p>"I do not despise him for his poverty&mdash;I do not despise
him at all. I said that you could not marry him because
almost from your cradle you have been promised to
another."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" said the girl, petulantly, to herself
but she asked, with seeming calmness:</p>

<p>"To whom, mamma?"</p>

<p>"To a splendid young gentleman of wealth and rank in
England."</p>

<p>"How romantic! Tell me all about it, dear mamma!"
cried Geraldine, anxious to know the worst.</p>

<p>"You are laughing at me, Geraldine," her mother cried,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"No, no, mamma; I was only smiling at my transformation.
Such a little while ago I was simply a poor shop-girl
in a New York dry-goods store, and engaged to marry
a fireman, who was considered an exceedingly good match
for me. Now I find myself a rich young heiress, betrothed
to an English nobleman. It is quite startling."</p>

<p>"I believe you regret your good fortune!" cried the lady.</p>

<p>Geraldine answered with a burst of tears.</p>

<p>For a few moments she sobbed vehemently; then calming
herself, she sighed.</p>

<p>"Dear mamma, I can never regret that I have found
you, but I can never cease to deplore your hardness of
heart that would part me from my heart's chosen one!"</p>

<p>"Hardness of heart," echoed the mother, reproachfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, you do not know how fondly I love him!"
sobbed the daughter, and for a little while there was a
painful silence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald was a woman of strong will and high
ambition.</p>

<p>She could not forego her plans for Geraldine.</p>

<p>So presently she said, soothingly:</p>

<p>"My darling girl, I know you would not wish to have
me break my plighted word. When I was in Europe, at the
time when you were two years old, I spent two months at
the home of a New York cousin of mine who had married
a rich lord. They had a son seven years old&mdash;a bright,
manly little lad&mdash;who fairly worshiped you; and one day
his mother said, gayly: 'Leland, why don't you ask little
Geraldine to be your wife when she grows up?'</p>

<p>"The pretty blue-eyed boy laughed and knelt down by
your side, repeating the question his mother had prompted,
and you kissed him and lisped 'yes.'"</p>

<p>"But I was only a baby, mamma. Of course, such a betrothal
was not binding," remonstrated Geraldine, though
she was touched at the pretty, childish betrothal.</p>

<p>"Wait till I have finished, darling. Lady Putnam, my
cousin, smiled at me with tears in her eyes, and said that
she hoped that the childish love would endure till they were
grown, and that they might indeed marry. I agreed to
this, and we solemnly betrothed the children next day,
buying a tiny diamond ring on purpose to fit your finger.
Little Leland was delighted with his promised bride, and
grieved bitterly when we left him and returned to New
York."</p>

<p>Geraldine was about to speak, but her mother interrupted:</p>

<p>"Wait, dear, till I have finished the story I began. Then
I will listen to your objections."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald sighed, and continued:</p>

<p>"I must touch briefly now on a subject painful to us
both&mdash;your father's faithlessness."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, how could he be false to one like you&mdash;so
noble, so beautiful?" cried Geraldine, in wonder.</p>

<p>"He was weak and easily flattered by a designing woman&mdash;that
is all I will say, Geraldine, for how can I disparage
an erring father to his child? Well, while I remained
at my cousin's in Devonshire, my husband kept
running back and forth to Paris, seeming infatuated by
its charms. At length a rumor reached me that he was
lavishing money and attention on a notorious woman who
had caught his fancy. I wrote to him, begging that he
would deny it, but he treated my letter with disdain,
plunging more recklessly into dissipation, and even appearing
in public by the side of the woman who had lured
him from me, seated in a magnificent vehicle he had purchased
for her use. To be brief, Geraldine, his vile conduct
killed every spark of love I ever had for him. I returned
to my home in New York and secured a divorce as
soon as possible, encouraged by my father, who was then
living. But he died in a few months, and afterward I was
very lonely, having no near relatives to cheer me except
you, my pet and darling. At a watering-place I met Mr.
Fitzgerald, and a mutual fascination for each other was
followed by an early marriage. Soon after our return
from our bridal tour, your father&mdash;enraged, perhaps that
I could find happiness with another&mdash;came to Chicago and
stole you away. A cruel fate foiled all my efforts to trace
you, until that day when chance brought us face to face."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do not call it chance, mamma; it was Providence,
surely, that saved me from that wretch!" cried pretty
Geraldine, fervently.</p>

<p>"We will call it Providence, then," agreed her mother,
and continued: "Until the last few years, when my heart
and thoughts were all occupied by your step-father's failing
health, I kept up a regular correspondence with my
cousin, Lady Putnam, and her letters were filled with
praises of her noble son, Leland. She had a sweet little
daughter also, called Amy, but her pride seemed to centre
in the boy who would inherit his father's rank and
wealth."</p>

<p>She paused, sighed, then added:</p>

<p>"Now, Geraldine, you see how I had planned your future
before you were so cruelly stolen from me. And now
that you have been restored to my heart, all my old ambitions
for you have revived. Can you wonder that I prefer
for you to marry noble Leland Putnam, whom I have
known and loved ever since his childhood, rather than a
stranger, who, however worthy, is poor and obscure, and
could not elevate you to the position your beauty merits?"</p>

<p>Geraldine had listened silently and earnestly. The romantic
story of her childish betrothal pleased her, but it
could not turn her true heart from its firm allegiance.</p>

<p>She said, gently:</p>

<p>"You have told me a deeply touching story, dear
mamma. I grieve that my own father proved so false and
unworthy, and I rejoice that I did not inherit his fickleness,
for my heart is true as steel to the first object of its
choice. I can never cease to love Harry Hawthorne, and
as for the betrothal you speak of, it was simply a childish
affair, forgotten, no doubt by all but yourself."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, my dear; for my cousin often mentioned
it in her letters after you were lost to us, as we
feared, forever. I shall write to her this very day, and
tell her you are found again."</p>

<p>"But not one word of that childish engagement, please,
mamma! I will not be offered to any man!" remonstrated
Geraldine, in alarm.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Geraldine. Of course, I know what is
due to you. But if Leland revives it of himself, if he still
claims you, you cannot refuse to marry him!"</p>

<p>Geraldine felt as if she were choking.</p>

<p>A cruel fate seemed to destine her to a loveless marriage.</p>

<p>Oh, how could her mother be so cruel, so heartless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
wrapped up in sordid ambition, reckless of a young heart's
misery!</p>

<p>Filled with fear and anger at her threatening fate, she
sprang to her feet, crying, passionately:</p>

<p>"Mamma, I do not wish to offend you, but&mdash;but&mdash;I will
not be forced into a loveless marriage. I will be true to
Harry, though the whole world oppose me! Why, I would
rather have remained a poor salesgirl forever than have
lost him, my own true love, by finding myself an heiress!"</p>

<p>The passionate defiance was out, and the mother knew
that all her ambitions were likely to be defeated by a
girl's perversity.</p>

<p>She called it perversity in her mind. She would not
own that it was love&mdash;constant, faithful love, that has
been the theme of poets since first they struck the sounding
lyre.</p>

<p>She did not want to excite the girl any further now,
though she determined that in the end she should yield
to her mother's will.</p>

<p>Rising from her seat, she quitted the room like a skillful
general, though casting one single glance backward that
rankled reproachfully in Geraldine's heart.</p>

<p>When Clifford Standish plunged the dagger into Hawthorne's
breast, and heard the groan of the victim, felt
the hot blood spurting over his hands as he rolled over in
the snow, he thought he had killed him.</p>

<p>But no pang of remorse touched his cruel heart.</p>

<p>He exulted in the deed that he had done.</p>

<p>Springing to his feet, he glanced hurriedly around, and
seeing no one near, coolly wiped his bloody hands on
Hawthorne's overcoat, and hastened away, exclaiming:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am rid of my dangerous rival at last!"</p>

<p>But there had been an unsuspected witness of the deadly
crime he had committed.</p>

<p>From a window above a young man had been looking
down just as the rivals closed in mortal combat.</p>

<p>He had come to the place to call on a friend who roomed
there, and learned that he was out, but was told that he
would be in directly.</p>

<p>Without removing his hat and overcoat, he walked restlessly
up and down the room, and at last became so impatient
that he pushed up the window and looked out to see
if his friend was yet in sight.</p>

<p>But the narrow street, its snowy expanse lighted by the
flaring electric lights, was deserted, save by two men,
who hurled themselves with tremendous force against
each other in deadly conflict.</p>

<p>Mr. Hill was not alarmed at first. He smiled, and murmured,
whimsically:</p>

<p>"Whew! A prize-fight! I bet on the one that whips!"</p>

<p>Oblivious of the cold air that rushed through the open
window into his friend's warm steam-heated apartment,
he leaned out and watched the contest, adding:</p>

<p>"I don't suppose they would thank me for spoiling their
sport, so I won't interfere. It's the blue-coat's business to
break it up, but they're never in place when needed."</p>

<p>The battle went on, and the unseen witness gazed admiringly
at the well-pitted antagonists.</p>

<p>He was a jovial young fellow, and he really felt inclined
to cheer the gallant athletes, so cleverly did they handle
each other.</p>

<p>But he restrained his inclination, and continued his
watching, and wondering who the combatants were and
which would gain the mastery.</p>

<p>But all at once he uttered a startled cry:</p>

<p>"Heavens! that was murder!"</p>

<p>He had heard the ripping sound of the dagger pressed
upward into the victim's breast, and his dying groan as
he rolled over in the snow.</p>

<p>Starting away from the window, he ran away from the
room into the hall, eager to make his way into the street.</p>

<p>In the lower hall he blundered against another man,
who caught him by the arm, saying, roughly:</p>

<p>"Hello! what are you running away like this for, eh?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, Doctor Rowe? Come with me, for
God's sake, into the street. I was looking out of the window,
and saw a murder being done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>They rushed into the street, but the little delay had
enabled the murderer to make his escape.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be seen of any human creature but that
still form lying there in a drift of snow that had turned
crimson with the blood that was spurting from his breast.</p>

<p>With exclamations of pity and horror, they bent over
him, the physician quickly feeling for his heart.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" asked Leroy Hill, his laughing dark eyes
growing soft with pity.</p>

<p>"Not yet; his heart beats faintly, but this flow of blood
must be stopped at once. It is very fortunate we came to
him so quickly," returned the old physician, tearing open
Hawthorne's shirt-bosom and preparing to stanch the flow
of blood.</p>

<p>Several people came out of the house and joined them,
and a crowd collected quickly, a policeman coming at last
around the corner.</p>

<p>Those who could assist the doctor did so, others plied
each other with questions.</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Who killed him?"</p>

<p>No one could answer either question.</p>

<p>No cards nor letters were found on the stranger's person
to prove his identity, and no one present recognized him.</p>

<p>Leroy Hill could only tell that he had seen the encounter
from an upper window, and that the assassin had escaped
before he reached the street.</p>

<p>Doctor Rowe looked up, asking: "Has any one 'phoned
for an ambulance to take him to the hospital? His last
chance of life will soon be gone if he has to lie here in the
street."</p>

<p>A bystander interposed, sarcastically:</p>

<p>"And he won't have much chance of life among some of
those brutal nurses at the hospital, neither."</p>

<p>Mr. Hill's absent friend had come up a moment before,
and the young man turned to him, saying, kindly:</p>

<p>"Let's give the poor devil a chance for his life, Ralph.
Can't we get a room in the house and hire a nurse for
him?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, Lee. Glad you thought of it! We will
put him in my bedroom and I can sleep on the lounge in
my study," returned Ralph Washburn who was an author,
and had the kindest heart in the world.</p>

<p>And so Harry Hawthorne found true friends among
those jolly, big-hearted Westerners, and, under their faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
ministrations, he came back to the life that had used
him so hardly.</p>

<p>And then they found that he was inclined to throw a
bit of a mystery around himself, for he was unwilling to
answer questions about anything.</p>

<p>"Don't think me ungrateful, boys," he said to Ralph
and Lee, as they sat by his bed. "God only knows how
grateful I am for your goodness, and I hope to prove it to
you some day. I'm from the North; I don't belong in Chicago&mdash;I'll
own that. I won't tell my name yet&mdash;call me
Jack Daly; that will do as well as anything until the time
comes when I can safely confess all."</p>

<p>They liked him in spite of his mysterious ways, for
there was too much nobility in his face to lead any one
astray. They felt sure that he was worthy of honor and
respect.</p>

<p>"But, Jack Daly," began Leroy Hill, smiling as he ran
his white hand through his clustering auburn curls, "I'm
going to ask you one question. Do you mean to shield the
man who tried to murder you?"</p>

<p>"To shield him? Was he not a stranger?"</p>

<p>"I do not believe he was a stranger to you. You did not
meet as strangers. You had a terrible quarrel. Perhaps it
was about a woman. Listen: I found a bloody glove in the
snow that night, and it belonged either to you or to him.
I deciphered in it a name&mdash;Clifford Standish!"</p>

<p>"Heavens!" exclaimed the patient.</p>

<p>"Then that is your name?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then it was your assailant's, and I am bound to put
the police in possession of this important clew."</p>

<p>The patient raised himself on his elbow, crying, feverishly:</p>

<p>"For God's sake! spare that villain, Mr. Hill; not for
his sake, no, no&mdash;but for a woman's sake! Listen: there is
a tragedy behind what you know. A woman's honor is involved,
and my silence is its only safeguard!"</p>

<p>"How strange, oh, how strange, that Harry does not
answer my letter!" cried Geraldine, impatiently.</p>

<p>About ten days had passed since she had posted the letter
with her own hands to Hawthorne, and for days she
had been waiting in silent anxiety for his reply.</p>

<p>But, as we know that he had left New York suddenly,
without leaving directions to forward his mail, we can
understand the cause of the silence that was torturing her
tender heart. Since the day when Geraldine had impulsively
defied her mother to turn her heart from her betrothed,
a slight reserve had grown up between them that
nothing seemed to bridge. Mrs. Fitzgerald never brought
up again the subject of her daughter's lover. She was
bitterly and unreasonably offended at the stand the girl
had taken.</p>

<p>So she became more chary of showing affection to Geraldine,
and lavished caresses on her two younger children,
the charming Earl and Claire.</p>

<p>Geraldine, who was as loving as she was proud and
willful, suffered sorely from her mother's coldness. She
began to feel like an alien in the great, splendid mansion.
In secret she pined for Cissy and her old happy life among
the girls at O'Neill's before her own mad ambition for the
stage had cut her off from those pleasant days forever.</p>

<p>"I have a great mind to run away from my grand home
and ambitious mother and go back to Cissy," she sobbed
one night to her lonely pillow.</p>

<p>But she did not have the heart to carry out her threat,
for Mrs. Fitzgerald was kind in spite of her reserve, lavishing
beautiful gowns and jewels upon her, as if to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
up to her for her heart-loneliness. Dressmakers and milliners
had <i>carte blanche</i>, and Geraldine had an outfit fine
enough for a young princess.</p>

<p>These beautiful gowns, these flashing jewels, and the
luxury of her home would have made the lovely girl very
happy, but for the cruel separation from her lover. Without
him there was a blank in everything.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where I am the halls are gilded,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Stored with pictures bright and rare;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Strains of deep, melodious music<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Float upon the perfumed air.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Slowly, heavily, and sadly<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Time with weary wings must flee,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Marked by pain and toil and sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Where I fain must be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One day a sudden thought came into her mind.</p>

<p>"Why not have Cissy come and make me a visit?"</p>

<p>She spoke to her mother about it the same day, asking
timidly for the privilege of inviting Cissy to spend a
month with her in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald readily acquiesced, and gave Geraldine
a liberal check for her friend's traveling expenses.</p>

<p>Geraldine flew to her room to write to her friend, and
she did not fail to inquire of Cissy what had become of
Harry Hawthorne.</p>

<p>"Tell him I have written to him and received no reply,"
she added, naively, in her keen anxiety.</p>

<p>She felt a little happier when the letter had been dispatched
to Cissy. It would be a comfort to have her old
friend with her, in spite of the fact that many of her
mother's rich, fashionable friends had called and offered
their friendship in affectionate terms.</p>

<p>But they were strange and new to Geraldine, and they
could not make her happy yet. The transplanted flower
had not taken root in this new, rich soil. It pined for its
old habitation. It was strange to be a greenhouse exotic
instead of a fresh wild-flower nodding to its mates beneath
the free blue sky.</p>

<p>"But if I only had those I love with me, I should be
supremely happy," she sighed, wistfully.</p>

<p>More than a week had passed since Clifford Standish's
visit, and they saw and heard no more of him.</p>

<p>Both mother and daughter supposed that he had passed
out of their lives forever.</p>

<p>But the handsome governess, Miss Erroll, might have
told them a different story had she dared.</p>

<p>She had received several letters from him, and she knew
from them that the actor was weaving a spider's web to
entrap poor Geraldine.</p>

<p>But she dared not speak, dared not warn the beautiful
unconscious victim.</p>

<p>She was in the villain's power, through his knowledge
of her past, and her terror for her own safety commanded
her silence.</p>

<p>She was a weak woman, who had erred and repented;
and now that she had begun to live a better life, she had a
terror of losing her situation. She could not betray Clifford
Standish, although she would have rejoiced in doing so
with safety to herself.</p>

<p>So the days went by, and it was almost a week since
Geraldine had written to Miss Carroll. She began to look
eagerly for an answer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald proposed a shopping tour the next day.</p>

<p>"You have not made the tour of the Chicago shops yet,
but I assure you they compare favorably with those of
New York. We will drive to State street, and go through
Marshall Field's immense establishment, which is one of
the finest here. Then, too, we must visit Stevens &amp;
Brothers' magnificent silk store. We may find something
to please us there. How sorry I am that I cannot introduce
you formally to society yet, because of my mourning.
You would be a vision of beauty in an evening dress."</p>

<p>Geraldine's thoughts flew back to the only time she had
ever worn an evening dress&mdash;the night of the firemen's
ball at Newburgh, when she had been so happy because
Harry Hawthorne's eyes had told her over and over of her
beauty. Ah, she would never be quite so happy again, she
feared.</p>

<p>They entered the elegant liveried carriage and were
driven to State street.</p>

<p>It was Geraldine's first shopping tour with her mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
and she found a great deal of zest in it, in spite of the sorrow
that ached at her loving heart.</p>

<p>How delightful it was to be buying beautiful fabrics instead
of selling them; to have a purse full of money to
spend on whatever she liked!</p>

<p>How different from the days of the shabby black serge
gown and the waiting on customers from morning till
night, with weary feet and oft-times aching back. She
looked at the pretty salesgirls of Chicago with kind, pitying
eyes, and was careful to give as little trouble as possible
when making her purchases. They looked at the rich
young beauty in her sealskin cloak enviously, little dreaming
that but a short while ago she had been a simple
working-girl like themselves, with no prospect of the good
fortune that had come to her so suddenly and strangely.</p>

<p>They re-entered the carriage, and Mrs. Fitzgerald gave
the address of an artist.</p>

<p>"I must have some picture of you in your carriage suit,
and this is such a bright, sunny day, just suited to a sitting,"
she said.</p>

<p>It pleased her to have her beautiful daughter photographed
in several graceful styles, then they left Stevens'
and proceeded home.</p>

<p>"You have had fatigue enough for one day, but we will
come out again to-morrow and see more of the city," said
Mrs. Fitzgerald, kindly.</p>

<p>The carriage drove away, and neither of them noticed
three men who had been walking slowly toward them as
they entered the carriage, and who had paused to gaze admiringly
at Geraldine as she crossed the pavement.</p>

<p>They were Ralph Washburn, Leroy Hill, and Harry
Hawthorne. The two former had brought their patient out
for the first time for a short walk.</p>

<p>He had convalesced very fast, the wound not being as
deep as at first supposed.</p>

<p>But the keen stroke of Standish had only missed a fatal
ending because it had been blunted by passing through a
cigar case in Hawthorne's breast-pocket.</p>

<p>His high health and vitality had enabled him to pull
through fast, and to-day he was out for the first time,
looking pale and thin, his restless glances roving from
side to side, seeking ever for one beautiful face so deeply
loved, so cruelly lost.</p>

<p>And suddenly he encountered it&mdash;where least expected&mdash;in
the garb and the trappings of wealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>He gave a gasp like one dying, and clutched young Hill's
arm in icy fingers.</p>

<p>The latter looked around, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"What is it, Jack, eh? Have we brought you too far in
your weak state? Oh, I see, you're looking at the beauty!
You're hard hit, aren't you? So am I! She's a stunner!"</p>

<p>At that moment the footman closed the door on Geraldine,
and the carriage rolled away.</p>

<p>She did not look out of the window, or she would have
seen Hawthorne&mdash;the lover over whom her fond heart
was yearning&mdash;start forward with outstretched arms toward
the carriage, crying, wildly:</p>

<p>"It is she! it is she! Stop the carriage, I say! I must
speak to her one moment!"</p>

<p>But his friends restrained him on either side. They
feared that he had suddenly gone daft.</p>

<p>Weak as he was, he struggled with them, broke their
hold, and ran a few paces after the carriage.</p>

<p>Then he dropped, exhausted, to the pavement.</p>

<p>They overtook him and raised him up between them.</p>

<p>He looked at them pleadingly.</p>

<p>"You think I am crazy, I know. But let me explain. I
know that girl in the carriage. I came to Chicago to find
her, and now, she has escaped me!" he groaned.</p>

<p>"What! you know the beautiful Miss Fitzgerald, of
Prairie avenue?" exclaimed Ralph Washburn, in surprise.</p>

<p>"That is not her name!" cried Hawthorne.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it is Miss Fitzgerald, certainly. You have
made a mistake," returned the young author, who had
seen Mrs. Fitzgerald often, and had read in the society
newspapers that her lovely daughter, Miss Fitzgerald,
who had been educated abroad, had just been called home
by her father's death.</p>

<p>But to make assurance doubly sure, he ran up to the
photographer's studio to inquire. They assured him that
their late sitters were Mrs. and Miss Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>Hawthorne was so unnerved by the discovery of his mistake
that a cab had to be called to take him home.</p>

<p>It was impossible for Hawthorne to sleep that night
after the sight of the beautiful stranger, Miss Fitzgerald,
whose startling likeness to his lost darling had awakened
in his heart a fresh agony of love and pain.</p>

<p>He tossed and turned restlessly all night upon his pillow,
thinking of Geraldine until his heart was on fire with
its agony.</p>

<p>Could it be true what that dastard Standish had told
him?</p>

<p>Had he indeed won the girl from the path of truth and
honor, to make shipwreck of her life for the sake of a
guilty love?</p>

<p>No, no, no! He could not, would not believe it!</p>

<p>She was pure as snow, his lovely Geraldine.</p>

<p>But where was she, what had been her fate since she
left New York in company with the arch-villain, Standish?</p>

<p>"I cannot find her by myself. I must put a detective on
the case to-morrow," he decided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>The young author, who was burning the midnight oil
over a charming poem, was disturbed by his groans, and
came in to see about him.</p>

<p>"I fear you are worse. That little outing was too much
for you," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No, it is not that. I am restless; it is a trouble of the
heart," confessed the patient, frankly.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Ralph, sympathetically, adding: "Can
I help you?"</p>

<p>"No one can help me," sighed Hawthorne, hopelessly.</p>

<p>"Is it a love affair?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It is hopeless, I judge, from your expressions. Then
why not throw it from your mind? Forget the cruel fair
one?"</p>

<p>"Have you ever loved, Ralph?"</p>

<p>"Never," laughed the handsome young author, who
only worshiped at the shrine of the muses.</p>

<p>"I thought not, or you would not use that hackneyed
word forget. It is impossible to real love&mdash;a poet's dream,
but an impossibility."</p>

<p>"Have you loved so deeply?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart, with all my soul, and with all my
mind!" groaned Hawthorne, adding: "My dear friend,
may God keep you from ever knowing such love and pain
and grief as fill my heart to bursting."</p>

<p>Ralph was silent. He saw that here was a grief beyond
comfort.</p>

<p>He wondered what was the mysterious nature of Hawthorne's
sad love-story, but he was too generous to ask
such a question.</p>

<p>He could only gaze at him in tender, silent sympathy.</p>

<p>Hawthorne continued, passionately:</p>

<p>"It is not my way to dwell on my own troubles, but to-night
my sorrow overwhelms me! To love and to lose&mdash;oh,
Ralph, that is the bitterest thing of life!"</p>

<p>"Is she dead, your loved one?"</p>

<p>"Ah! no, she is not dead! I could almost wish that she
were, in my dread that she is dead to me forever! And if
she is, oh, if she is, how can I bear the gloom of my life
henceforward?&mdash;the blank darkness of a night of storm
following on the sunshine of a perfect day. Oh, God!"
groaned Hawthorne, tossing his arms above his pillow in
anguish.</p>

<p>The young poet gazed at him in deepest sympathy and
pity. He had not loved yet, but he could understand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
pity, for to the poet's soul all the secrets of life are felt and
known through the subtle occultism of genius.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The poet in a golden clime was born,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With golden stars above;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dowered with the hate of hate, the scorn of scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The love of love.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He saw through life and death, through good and ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">saw through his own soul."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As Ralph gazed at the handsome face of the unhappy
lover, he felt that here was the material for a novelist's
pen to frame a most bewitching love-story, and he hoped
that some day Hawthorne would confide in him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the young man looked up at him, saying,
abruptly:</p>

<p>"Ralph, I want you to take me to the best detective in
Chicago to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Ralph, going to a table and mixing
a sedative that had been used under Doctor Rowe's orders.
He presented it to the patient, saying:</p>

<p>"Drink this, or you won't be able to stir to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>Hawthorne complied readily, for he was, indeed, weary
of the tumult of his mind and heart.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes wearily, and Ralph dimmed the light
and returned to his study, and the last verse of the pretty
poem he was composing.</p>

<p>When he had written the last line he heard Hawthorne
breathing gently in a saving sleep, and he, too, retired to
his bed.</p>

<p>Both slept late the next morning, and breakfast and the
morning papers were brought up together for Hawthorne.</p>

<p>Ralph saw that his charge was comfortable, and went
out to a neighboring <i>cafe</i> where he was wont to meet his
friend Mr. Hill at the morning meal.</p>

<p>Hawthorne made a very light meal in bed, dismissed
the servant with the tray, and then turned his attention to
the newspapers&mdash;the Chicago <i>Herald</i> first.</p>

<p>And as he skimmed over the telegraphic news from
abroad, he came across a paragraph that worked a curious
change in him.</p>

<p>His face grew pale with emotion, and sinking back on
his pillow, he sighed to himself:</p>

<p>"I must go home."</p>

<p>When Ralph returned with Mr. Hill, who always made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
a morning call on his <i>protege</i>, as he humorously termed
Hawthorne, they found the patient dressing in feverish
haste.</p>

<p>"Boys, I must return to New York to-day," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>While they gazed at him in surprise, he continued:</p>

<p>"Business of a very important nature obliges me to
cross the ocean as soon as possible; and&mdash;in brief&mdash;I owe
you both a debt of gratitude that I wish to repay you by
asking you to accompany me on my trip to Europe as my
guests. Will you come? I am not poor, as you supposed, in
the kindness of your hearts, when you took me in, a
stranger, and nursed and cared for me, and a cordial welcome
will meet you in my English home!"</p>

<p>They were startled and surprised at his generosity, but
Hawthorne would not listen to their refusals.</p>

<p>"I love you both like brothers, and I will not be refused.
You shall come with me," he declared, and his cordiality
won their consent.</p>

<p>Arrangements were speedily made, and after a visit to a
detective, the three friends left for New York.</p>

<p>All unconscious of the fact that she had been so near to
the lover for whom she mourned, Geraldine returned
home with her mother, and even as they went up the steps
the postman followed on his afternoon round and placed
two letters in her hand.</p>

<p>She glanced at them, and a cry of joy broke from her
lips as she saw that one bore the New York postmark and
was in Cissy's familiar hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>The other one was postmarked Chicago, and was addressed
to the governess, Miss Erroll.</p>

<p>And if Geraldine could have guessed how fatally that
letter concerned herself, she would have been justified in
tearing it to fragments and scattering it in wrath to the
four winds of heaven.</p>

<p>If some saving hypnotic power had but impelled her to
this course, what suffering she would have been spared.
But in her joy over Cissy's letter, she scarcely gave a
thought to Miss Erroll.</p>

<p>Going up stairs to her own apartments, she passed the
school-room and tapped lightly on the door.</p>

<p>"A letter for you," she said, courteously, to the governess,
not noticing how the woman's hand trembled, when
she took it.</p>

<p>But the face of Miss Erroll grew ashy pale when, alone
with her pupils, she opened and read her letter from
Clifford Standish.</p>

<p>"To think that she should have this letter in her
hands; that she should have brought it to me, it is a
mockery of fate! It is like&mdash;suicide!" she muttered,
through her writhing lips, and a bitter sigh heaved her
breast.</p>

<p>Geraldine hurried to her own rooms and read Cissy's
letter before she removed her wraps, so eager was her
fond heart for news from New York.</p>

<p>"She will be here to-morrow, to-morrow, the dear girl!"
she cried, joyfully, kissing the letter in the exuberance of
her gladness.</p>

<p>But the letter contained other news that was very puzzling.</p>

<p>"Harry followed me to Chicago on the next train, the
darling boy! But how strange that he has never come to
me! Does he know where I am? Is he in the same city
with me?" were questions that repeated themselves over
and over in her bewildered brain.</p>

<p>She could understand now why he had never answered
her letter. Of course, he had never received it, since he
was on her trail following her abductor and his victim in
their flight from New York.</p>

<p>"But why, oh, why does he not come to me? Is it possible
he cannot find me, my dear, dear, love? Ah, I have it
now! He is following Clifford Standish up, and of course
he can find no trace of me," she decided, and immediately
resolved to insert personals in the prominent newspapers
of the next day in the hope of reaching him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>When she had exchanged her carriage dress for a lovely
house robe, fluttering with lace and ribbons, she sought
her mother, with Cissy's letter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald rejoiced with her daughter over the
coming of her friend, but she said not a word about Harry
Hawthorne.</p>

<p>She was secretly annoyed at learning that he had followed
Geraldine to Chicago. She thought, in dismay:</p>

<p>"He may be turning up here at any moment, claiming
my daughter, and she is so headstrong, she will never
consent to give him up. What shall I do?"</p>

<p>But her woman's wit could suggest no answer to the
question.</p>

<p>She was honorable and high-minded, and shrank from
using harsh or underhand means to break off Geraldine's
engagement.</p>

<p>Geraldine saw the lack of sympathy in her mother's mobile
face, and thought, sadly:</p>

<p>"She is still unrelenting. I shall have no sympathy in
my sorrow until Cissy comes. Then I can whisper all my
grief to her faithful heart."</p>

<p>And she longed all the more anxiously for to-morrow's
sun that would shine on the coming of her beloved friend.</p>

<p>And, to lighten her suspense, she spent some time superintending
the arrangement of the beautiful room next to
her own that was being prepared for Miss Carroll's occupancy.
Some of her own favorite books were carried in&mdash;Cissy
was inordinately fond of reading&mdash;flowers were lavished
here and there. When it was all ready, the pretty
room in pink and silver was dainty enough for a princess.</p>

<p>"Cissy will enjoy it so much. She likes pretty things.
And I shall buy her some dainty gowns, and&mdash;lots of
things! She shall see how I love her!" the girl whispered
to herself, with tears of joy in her beautiful brown eyes.</p>

<p>Then she went to her desk and wrote out and sent the
personals she had thought of to the newspapers for to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Mamma would not approve, I know, but perhaps she
will never find out what I have done. But, at any risk, I
would have done it. I cannot give up my own true love! I
believe God made us for each other," she thought, tenderly.</p>

<p>She spent a restless night, thinking of Cissy's coming
to-morrow, and wondering where her lover was to-night
in this great Western city, little dreaming that he was
speeding from it in the deepening night.</p>

<p>The long winter night was over, and with the morning's
sunshine Geraldine's heart began to beat with eager expectancy.</p>

<p>A few hours more and sweet Cissy would be here!
Cissy, her old friend, who would sympathize with her in
all her trials, and perhaps help her to a way out of them.</p>

<p>After breakfast she hastened to her room, leaving Mrs.
Fitzgerald intent on the morning papers.</p>

<p>She did not wish to be present should her mother chance
to peruse the personal column.</p>

<p>"Conscience makes cowards of us all," she quoted, nervously
to herself, fancying her proud parent's indignation
when she should read, staring her in the face:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>TO HARRY HAWTHORNE&mdash;I am safe and well, and wondering
what has become of you. Do you wish to see me? If so,
answer this personal to-morrow, giving your address, and I will write
to you, with instructions how to find me.</p>

<p class="center">

<p class="sig">
G. H.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, how happy it would have made her lover's heart if
he had chanced on that message in the papers he read that
morning.</p>

<p>But, by one of the terrible blunders of fate, he had read,
as always, the telegraphic news first, and then thrown the
papers from him, in that wild excitement that had determined
him to return to New York at once.</p>

<p>Soon the broad, illimitable ocean would roll between
their yearning hearts.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard her mother's step at the door, and
sprang up in nervous alarm.</p>

<p>"She has discovered it already, and is coming to reproach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
me," thought the hapless girl, bracing herself to
meet the storm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald came in excitedly, clutching the newspaper
in her hand.</p>

<p>"Mamma!" cried Geraldine, tremulously, entreatingly,
as if to pray for mercy in advance.</p>

<p>"Geraldine, I have found a startling paragraph in this
paper," cried the lady, without noticing her daughter's
agitation.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma," Geraldine answered, forlornly, pushing
forward a seat.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald sat down, the paper rustling nervously
in her hand. She cleared her throat and began.</p>

<p>"You remember the story I told you about my cousin,
Lady Putnam, and her son?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma," Geraldine replied, again, meekly, and
the lady continued:</p>

<p>"I have not heard from my cousin for several years, and
I have just read in the telegraphic news from abroad that
her husband, Lord Randolph Putnam, is dead."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," Geraldine answered, gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh, as to him, it doesn't matter much. He was an old
man, gouty and disagreeable," replied Mrs. Fitzgerald,
frankly, adding: "The interest of the matter centres in his
son and heir&mdash;Leland, now Lord Putnam&mdash;your betrothed!
I was surprised to read here that several years ago the old
lord and his son had a bitter quarrel&mdash;so bitter that the
heir was driven from home, and vowed that he would
never return while his father lived. He went to America,
and all trace of him was lost. Now there is a great hue
and cry for him everywhere, for he is wanted to return
and assume his rank and estate. But, of course, he will
be found, as missing people always come back when they
inherit money."</p>

<p>Geraldine was so relieved that her mother had not come
to upbraid her about the personals to Hawthorne that she
affected a great interest in what she had just heard.</p>

<p>"Do let me read it myself, mamma," she exclaimed,
eager to get possession of the newspaper before the lady
should find any more startling paragraphs in it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald readily gave up the paper, her excitement
over the news she had just read having destroyed all
interest in anything else.</p>

<p>"I shall write to my cousin at once, to condole with her

"It is quite a coincidence that both of us should be

but what can I do? I must not forsake my true-hearted
lover for the sake of a mere prejudice."</p>

<p>And believing that she would be sure to hear from the
personal very soon, her heart grew light with joy.</p>

<p>Soon it was time to go and meet Cissy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald accompanied her daughter to the station
to meet her friend, and when she saw Miss Carroll,
she liked her at once.</p>

<p>She had been dreading to see a very ordinary girl indeed;
but Cissy's beauty and style, above all her lady-like
manners, won their way at once to her proud heart.</p>

<p>And she was so glad, too, over Geraldine's happy looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
that she felt almost grateful to Cissy for accepting her invitation.</p>

<p>What a happy day the girls spent together!</p>

<p>They had so much to tell each other that the hours
passed like minutes.</p>

<p>Cissy was rejoiced when she heard of the discomfiture of
Clifford Standish, whom she had always disliked and distrusted.</p>

<p>"You know I warned you against him, but you would
not listen," she said.</p>

<p>"I was a silly, stage-struck little goose, that was the
reason; but I have been well punished for my ambition,"
Geraldine replied, frankly.</p>

<p>"Then you have no further desire for a stage career?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, dear. My experience on the road quite
cured me of that. Why, I was never so hard worked and
unhappy in my life. Besides, after all, I don't think I had
any great talent for acting. I had some triumphs, it is
true, but I believe it was only because I was rather
pretty," Geraldine owned, candidly, and then the conversation
drifted to other subjects.</p>

<p>"You have not seen my little half-brother and sister
yet. They are beautiful and charming little children, and
love me dearly already," she said. "Their governess, Miss
Erroll, is one of the handsomest women I ever saw&mdash;fair
and stately, and with that look in her face, somehow, as
of one who has an interesting story in her past."</p>

<p>"And do you know the story?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; she came to mamma from New York, I believe,
with very good recommendations. That is all we
know; but the children get on well with her, and she
seems to study to please every one."</p>

<p>They were alone in Cissy's dainty room, lounging at
ease in their pretty dressing-gowns. It was bedtime and
past, but Geraldine could not tear herself away.</p>

<p>"Are you tired of me? Do you want me to go?" she
queried.</p>

<p>"I could talk to you all night, darling!" cried Cissy,
brightly, without guessing to what the confession would
lead.</p>

<p>But Geraldine came over and put a coaxing arm around
her neck.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you aren't tired, for, Cissy, I'm just dying
to take up our conversation where we left it off, you know,
that Christmas evening when we were parted so suddenly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Cissy, remembrance rushing over her in a
burning wave.</p>

<p>"You were about to tell me a delightful love-story, and
I was all impatience to hear it. It was about Cameron
Clemens, you know. You owned that he was once your
lover. Now please go on with the story, that's a dear!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Geraldine, how you like to listen to love-stories!"
sighed Miss Carroll, with a far-away look in her soft gray
eyes.</p>

<p>"Of course. All girls are fond of love-stories!" laughed
Geraldine, and she added: "You know all about my love
affairs, Cissy; now you must tell me about yours."</p>

<p>And she kept up her entreaties until Cissy sighed and
yielded, saying:</p>

<p>"You don't know how I hate to rake up the ashes of the
past, dear, and go over all my trouble again, but I will do
it for your sake, although I dare say you will not find it
very interesting."</p>

<p>"Were you ever engaged to Mr. Clemens, Cissy?" exclaimed
Geraldine, plunging at once into the subject.</p>

<p>"Yes," acknowledged Cissy.</p>

<p>"Tell me how it came about, dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in the usual way&mdash;we fell in love."</p>

<p>"But how?&mdash;where?&mdash;when?" persisted Geraldine, with
charming eagerness.</p>

<p>Miss Carroll saw that there was no escaping the importunities
of the charming little tease, so she answered, with
pretending carelessness:</p>

<p>"Taking your last question first, I met him five years
ago. As to where, it was at the sea-shore. We used to go
there every summer before dear grandpa failed in business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and had to move out to the country, to the only home
left him, the little farm where I first knew you."</p>

<p>"Yes, go on," breathed Geraldine, eagerly, and with a
pensive little sigh, Miss Carroll continued:</p>

<p>"We met at the sea-shore, as I have told you&mdash;at that
gay resort, Atlantic City. We danced together in the
evenings, flirted on the sands and in the water, rode,
boated, watched the sea by moonlight, and he taught me
how to swim and to row. I was very happy."</p>

<p>"I know just how it was," sighed Geraldine.</p>

<p>"We became engaged," continued Cissy. "My grandfather
was opposed to actors, and was not pleased with my
engagement, but he relented, and gave his consent when
he saw how my heart was set on it. Cameron pleaded for
an early marriage, and before I returned to New York the
wedding-day was set for the first of December. My trousseau
was bought and in the hands of the dressmakers."</p>

<p>Cissy's voice faltered, and she brushed away some pearly
tears that had brimmed over on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Poor darling," murmured Geraldine, caressingly.</p>

<p>"Don't pity me, dear. I&mdash;I&mdash;can't bear it. Let me finish,"
cried Cissy, and she hurried on:</p>

<p>"Just a few weeks before the wedding-day, an actress
in his company came to see me. She was a great beauty,
and she told me that Mr. Clemens had been her lover, betrothed
to her before he ever saw me. She declared that if
I did not give him up it would kill her, and raved so wildly
that I sent for Cameron. He came, and was very angry
when he saw her, but she raged like a tigress, and claimed
him passionately. He admitted that he had promised to
marry her, but after seeing me, repented his engagement,
and tried to get free, but she would not release him, so he
was going to marry me anyway. Geraldine, you can fancy
my feelings, perhaps. Although I knew it would break my
heart, I dismissed my lover, bidding him return to his old
love, who had cruelly wounded me by hinting that it was
grandpa's money he wanted, not me."</p>

<p>"Well?" breathed Geraldine, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, I declined all his overtures toward reconciliation,
and a few months after he married Azuba Aylesford, the
actress. The marriage was not a happy one, and within
two years she deserted him, going off with some Western
actor, whose name I never heard. Cameron secured a divorce&mdash;but
that is all, really. Grandpa died in the meantime,
and when the mortgage was paid off on the farm,
there was so little left that I came to New York to earn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
my bread. So, there, it was not so much of a love story
after all," sadly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it was very interesting, and it may have a
happy ending yet. I rather pity poor Mr. Clemens."</p>

<p>"You should not, for he does not deserve it&mdash;false to two
women, as he was!" flashed Cissy. Then she kissed Geraldine,
saying: "Good-night, dear one, and don't let us
refer to this painful subject again."</p>

<p>While Geraldine and Cissy were exchanging confidences,
Miss Erroll, the governess, was keeping an unhappy vigil
in her own room.</p>

<p>In her hand she held the letter that Geraldine had
brought to her the day before, and as often as she read it
she groaned in anguish.</p>

<p>The letter was from Clifford Standish, the actor. It ran,
curtly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You have begged me not to betray you, to let you keep
the position you hold in Mrs. Fitzgerald's family unmolested.
Of course, you expect to pay a price for my charitable
silence.</p>

<p>"Very well. Here are my conditions:</p>

<p>"I love Geraldine Harding, and her
scorn has made me reckless, desperate.</p>

<p>"I am determined to get her into my power, and humble
her towering pride.</p>

<p>"You must help me to carry out my designs.</p>

<p>"In brief, I am determined to kidnap her and conceal
her in a safe place, where she cannot escape my attentions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
She came very near to loving me once, and I think if I am
given a good opportunity, I may win her heart again.</p>

<p>"I am arranging a place for her, and by to-morrow I
shall have everything ready for my pretty bird.</p>

<p>"Some plan must be perfected then by which to get possession
of the girl.</p>

<p>"As you are in the same house with her, and know all
her comings and goings, your woman's wit ought to be
able to suggest some plan of procedure without drawing
suspicion on yourself.</p>

<p>"Set your wits to work, and write to me to-morrow what
you can do to help me.</p>

<p>"And remember that the penalty of refusal will be exposure
of your past to the girl's mother, and expulsion in
disgrace from your comfortable situation.</p>

<p class="sig">
C. S."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"The man is a fiend!" groaned Miss Erroll, rising from
her seat, and pacing up and down the luxurious apartment,
her crimson dressing-gown trailing far behind her on the
soundless velvet carpet.</p>

<p>She loved luxury, this woman, and she had sinned to attain
it, but everything seemed to go wrong in her life.
Punishment for her sins seemed to follow on her footsteps.</p>

<p>So she had put the past behind her, and tried to reform
her life.</p>

<p>But ghosts from the dead past would rise up and haunt
her, troubling her repose.</p>

<p>"The man is a fiend!" she groaned again. "Why cannot
he leave that beautiful, innocent girl in peace? I have
done wrong in my life, I know, but nothing so bad as
what he asks of me, to lend myself to a vile plot against
the peace of a girl who has never harmed me, a girl who
has won my liking by her high-bred courtesy, as freely
given to me as if I were her equal, instead of a paid dependent.
How kind and good they all are to me, and how
can I repay their bounty by such treachery?"</p>

<p>All the good in her nature rose to the surface, and did
battle against the wrong she was asked to do.</p>

<p>And yet she dared not refuse; dared not risk what her
tempter threatened.</p>

<p>Cruel had been her battle with poverty before she obtained
this situation.</p>

<p>And if she lost it the dire struggle would begin again.</p>

<p>She might not be able to get honest work; she might be
tossed into the terrible maelstrom of women who had to
sin for bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet how could she, who was trying to redeem her own
life from a hideous stain, how could she vilely plan to
wreck another's life?</p>

<p>It was a terrible struggle that was going on in her breast
as she kept her lonely vigil there.</p>

<p>She had not answered the letter yet, although he had
commanded her to send a reply to-day. She waited in terror,
silent, yet hoping that something would interpose to
save her&mdash;praying that ere the morrow dawned her persecutor
would fall down dead.</p>

<p>"It is no harm, no sin, to wish him dead, that fiend who
only lives to plan ruin for the innocent," she cried, in anguish,
crumpling the fatal letter in her writhing hands.</p>

<p>Then she gave a violent start, and looked toward the
door, her hair seeming to rise on her head with terror.</p>

<p>Did she really hear a low rat-tat upon her door there in
the dead waste and middle of the night?</p>

<p>She stood motionless, with her handsome head turned
toward the door in an attitude of startled expectancy.</p>

<p>The low knocking came again, and then a low, sweet
voice called, softly:</p>

<p>"Are you asleep? It's only me! Please let me in, dear?"</p>

<p>The voice sounded like that of Claire, her sweet little
girl pupil.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief she moved to the door and cautiously
opened it.</p>

<p>The next moment she started back with a shuddering
cry of fear that was echoed by the figure on the threshold.</p>

<p>The intruder was Cissy Carroll, with her long, dark hair
flying loose over her white dressing gown.</p>

<p>With startled outcries, they gazed at each other, and
then Miss Carroll demanded, shrilly:</p>

<p>"Do my eyes deceive me? What are you doing here,
Azuba Aylesford?"</p>

<p>The woman in the scarlet robe darted forward, and
dragged the white-clad girl into the room, whispering, in
terrified tones:</p>

<p>"Hush-h! for sweet pity's sake! Do not breathe that
name beneath this roof!"</p>

<p>She closed the door softly, and they stood looking at
each other in wonder and dismay, while Cissy, recovering
her wits, retorted, sharply:</p>

<p>"By what name shall I call you, then, since your divorce
from Mr. Clemens?"</p>

<p>"Call me Miss Erroll. Azuba Aylesford and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Clemens are both dead. From her ashes rises Kate Erroll,
governess."</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" and Cissy remembered what Geraldine had told
her about the governess with a history in her face. She
understood it now.</p>

<p>Light was also dawning on the other, and she asked:</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you, Miss Carroll, are the guest who
arrived to-day from New York?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I did not dream of finding you here, Miss&mdash;Erroll.
When I knocked at the door, I supposed this was
Miss Harding's room. My head ached, and I wished to ask
for some camphor."</p>

<p>"You were mistaken. Her room is on one side of yours,
mine on the other, hence the mistake."</p>

<p>"I am sorry I disturbed you. I will withdraw now,"
said Cissy, in her coldest tone, moving toward the door.</p>

<p>But suddenly she was prevented from going by Miss
Erroll falling madly at her feet.</p>

<p>"You shall not go yet&mdash;not till&mdash;not till&mdash;you promise
not to betray me to your friends, not to tell them of my
wicked past!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Cissy Carroll drew back her robe from contact with the
kneeling suppliant. Her face was very pale, and her eyes
flashed with scorn.</p>

<p>"Why should I spare you, woman? You did not spare
me&mdash;nor him!" she answered, bitterly.</p>

<p>"That is true&mdash;oh, how true! But I have been bitterly
punished for my sins&mdash;so bitterly that even those I have
wronged might pity me. I sinned, but I have suffered!"
moaned the kneeling woman, lifting despairing eyes to
her accuser.</p>

<p>"The way of the transgressor is hard," answered Cissy,
with the harshness of woman to woman.</p>

<p>"Do I not know it! Alas! alas!" moaned Kate Erroll,
and she continued: "Now that I have repented my sins,
and am trying to be good, my past rises up to menace me
on every hand with danger!"</p>

<p>Cissy Carroll did not answer, and she could not pity, for
had not this woman robbed her life of happiness?</p>

<p>Suddenly Kate Erroll asked, eagerly:</p>

<p>"Have you never forgiven Cameron Clemens yet?"</p>

<p>"He has never asked me," Cissy returned, evasively.</p>

<p>"He would not dare after the scorn with which you dismissed
him when I put in my claim to him. Ah, Miss Carroll,
you did wrong, and you made my victory an easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
one. If you had clung to him he would never have turned
to me."</p>

<p>Cissy did not answer, save by the curl of a disdainful lip.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wronged you both most bitterly," Kate Erroll
added, with keen, though late remorse. "Listen: I never
loved Cameron Clemens&mdash;never; I only angled for him because
he was a good catch, and I, a poor actress, loved
luxury, and wanted to make a good marriage. He was not
in love with me, but I pushed the flirtation so far that he
could not avoid the proposal. I am sure he scarcely regarded
our flirtation seriously. Before it was a week old
he went away for his summer outing. He met you, and
fell in love in earnest. He wrote to me, and asked release.
I was furious, and would not reply. I waited&mdash;waited until
just before the marriage. Then I swooped down on you,
enraged you with hints that he was after your grandfather's
money. You dismissed him with furious scorn&mdash;just
what I wanted; and I&mdash;oh, shame to my womanhood,
for I did not love him!&mdash;I pursued him till he made me
his wife!"</p>

<p>"You did not love him? Oh, Heaven! yet you wrecked
both our lives for selfish gain!" groaned Cissy, appalled at
the woman's confession.</p>

<p>"It was cruel, oh, I know it now, but I did not then, for
I had never loved, and could not realize the anguish of
your loss. But I have been punished for my sins, I tell
you. Of course, we led a wretched life, hating each other
after a short time most bitterly. Then the tempter came
in the person of a handsome young actor who taught me
the meaning of love. He begged me to elope with him,
promising to marry me as soon as my husband secured a
divorce. Well, I fled with him, and Mr. Clemens lost no
time in applying to the courts for a dissolution of his marriage
bonds. Soon I was free; but did my betrayer keep
his promise to me? Ah, no; he laughed me to scorn, and
told me he already had a wife. All my love turned to
hate, and I fled from him as from the presence of a leper.
All my life since has been a struggle for honest bread. I
could not return to the stage, for I could not live down the
awful notoriety of my sin. Fortunately, I had a good education,
and after months of wretchedness, during which I
buried a nameless child, I secured this situation with these
noble people. Will you let me keep it, or will you take
your just revenge?"</p>

<p>Her tremulous voice wavered and broke; then silence
fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>She remained kneeling in a suppliant position at the feet
of the woman she had wronged so bitterly, her large blue
eyes upraised in passionate appeal.</p>

<p>Cissy Carroll stood like a statue in front of the kneeling
woman, her face death-white, her eyes sombre, with painful
thought.</p>

<p>It was her hour of triumph.</p>

<p>Her enemy was delivered into her hand.</p>

<p>Her vengeance was assured, if she chose to take it.</p>

<p>Why should she not? she thought, in the first bitterness
of the meeting with the woman who had wronged her so
deeply.</p>

<p>Then something else came to her mind.</p>

<p>"'Vengeance is mine; I will repay,' saith the Lord."</p>

<p>Looking at the humble suppliant there, she felt that
punishment had already been meted out to her in fullest
measure.</p>

<p>She could almost pity now instead of spurning the
wretched creature who, having dashed love's brimming
cup from the thirsty lips of another, had been forced to
drink its bitter lees herself.</p>

<p>She moved back a pace, and said, quietly:</p>

<p>"Rise. You are safe from vengeance of mine."</p>

<p>"You will forgive me?" faltered the governess, gratefully.</p>

<p>Cissy answered, coldly:</p>

<p>"I did not say I would forgive you, for I do not think I
ever can. But I will not betray your secret. To-morrow
we may meet as strangers, who have no interest in each
other."</p>

<p>She moved toward the door, followed by protestations
of undying gratitude to which she made no reply.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she could not breathe freely in the
presence of this woman, to whom she owed all her misery.
She fled to her own room to weep in solitude.</p>

<p>But, leaving our interests in the Garden City temporarily,
we must journey across the dark-blue sea, to follow
the fortunes of our noble hero, Harry Hawthorne.</p>

<p>As the intelligent reader has doubtless surmised already,
he was the hero of the newspaper paragraph Mrs. Fitzgerald
had read to her daughter, and he had crossed the seas
to claim his own.</p>

<p>Young blood is often too hot, and an angry quarrel with
his old father had made the heir of a noble name and fine
estate a voluntary exile from home under distant skies,
where he was not too proud to earn his bread by honest
toil.</p>

<p>But all that was changed now.</p>

<p>In the English county of Devonshire, at the grand old
castle home of Raneleigh, the old lord lay dead, and my
lord, his son, must lay aside his masquerading and come
home to wear the honors and the title that were his by
ancestral right.</p>

<p>His two Chicago friends were charmed with his romance
when he told it to them, one day on the steamer, just before
they landed on the bonny shore of England.</p>

<p>"I only borrowed the name of Jack Daly," he laughed.
"The one that belongs to me is Harry Leland, and my title
will be Lord Putnam."</p>

<p>They congratulated him warmly. It was a romance in
real life, they said, and Ralph Washburn declared he
should weave it into a novel.</p>

<p>"But you do not know the most romantic part of it yet,"
said the young man, with a sigh. He debated the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
with himself a moment, then decided it could do no harm
to confide in his two noble friends.</p>

<p>So, sadly enough, he told them the story of the love
affair that had brought him to Chicago, keeping back
nothing.</p>

<p>"So now you know how I came by the wound that made
you two my stanch friends for life, and you can understand
why I let my enemy alone, rather than bring into
publicity the name of a woman I loved," he ended.</p>

<p>"But you left the case in the hands of a detective?" said
Leroy Hill.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is to find Clifford Standish and shadow him
until it is found out whether he lied to me about Miss
Harding. He has full instructions to act in my place during
my absence."</p>

<p>"And this beautiful girl that you loved when you were
simply Harry Hawthorne, the New York fireman, do you
mean that if she is found and proved innocent that you
will stoop to her now that you have come into your ancestral
honors?" inquired the romantic young author,
with interest.</p>

<p>"If I were a king I would raise her to my throne!" replied
the ardent lover, proudly.</p>

<p>They applauded his faithful love, but they thought that
the prospect of his happiness looked very dismal.</p>

<p>The actor's story seemed so plausible that they feared it
might be true that he had won the vacillating heart of
pretty Geraldine.</p>

<p>They looked at each other significantly, but they did not
have the heart to breathe their doubts aloud. They saw
that he was already unhappy enough.</p>

<p>But they felt sure in their hearts that if the detective
ever traced the movements of the persons in whom Hawthorne
was interested, he would report Standish's story as
true.</p>

<p>When they had been in England a week, having witnessed
the joy of the mother over the truant's return, and
had been the recipients of the most charming hospitalities
from the family, a letter came from the Chicago detective
to Lord Putnam.</p>

<p>But the information it contained was very meagre.</p>

<p>He had traced Clifford Standish through a very clever
disguise, but the whereabouts of Miss Harding remained a
mystery.</p>

<p>In fact, the detective was inclined to believe that the
actor had lost interest in the girl he had brought to Chicago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Perhaps he had wearied of her, and left her to despair.
At any rate, he was conducting a correspondence,
perhaps a flirtation with a handsome governess, Miss
Erroll, employed by Mrs. Fitzgerald, a wealthy widow, on
Prairie avenue.</p>

<p>The pride of Geraldine's mother and her repugnance to
the name of her first husband had induced her, on bringing
the girl to Chicago, to give out to the newspapers the
paragraphs for publication stating that her daughter, Miss
Fitzgerald, had been called home from school by the death
of her father. Even in the household Geraldine bore the
same name, and thus the clever detective was baffled by
the simple substitution of another name; and while he had
traced Clifford Standish up to his very entrance to the
Prairie avenue mansion, he had no suspicion that the
actor was interested in any one of the family besides the
handsome governess.</p>

<p>But the same mail had brought Lady Putnam also a letter
from Chicago, and when she had read it she called her
son into her boudoir, where she sat alone, saying, in a
flutter of excitement:</p>

<p>"I have a letter from America, dear Leland, and as you
are so fond of everything American, perhaps you can remember
the beautiful little American girl to whom you
were betrothed when she was only about two years old?"</p>

<p>The handsome young lord looked at his mother in
surprise when she uttered those words: "Perhaps you remember
the beautiful little American girl to whom you
were betrothed when she was barely two years old?"</p>

<p>That episode of his childish days had almost escaped the
young man's memory, so he said, carelessly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Putnam looked startled, and said, hastily:</p>

<p>"Of course, you would not consider a trifle like that
binding on a grown man."</p>

<p>The stately mother looked somewhat disappointed, and
answered, slowly:</p>

<p>"I had hoped it might be, especially as you have no
other entanglement."</p>

<p>"Why are you so sure of that, my dear mother?"</p>

<p>She started, and gave him a frightened look.</p>

<p>"Oh, I&mdash;I&mdash;hope there is none," she said, vaguely.</p>

<p>For a moment it came to him to tell her this love story.</p>

<p>"A mother's sympathy would be very sweet," he
thought.</p>

<p>But a sudden impulse of pride restrained him.</p>

<p>"For what if it be proved that Geraldine is unworthy?
How could I bear to be pitied?" he thought, with the sensitive
pride of true manhood.</p>

<p>So he answered, evasively:</p>

<p>"I was only teasing you, dear mother. Go on with the
story you have to tell me."</p>

<p>With a quick sigh of relief, she plunged into the subject:</p>

<p>"As I was saying, when you were a manly little lad of
seven, a cousin of mine, from New York, paid me a long
visit here, and she had with her a lovely little daughter of
two years. You and the little girl were almost inseparable,
so much so that my cousin Florence and myself began
to look forward to a possible future that might unite your
destinies in one. In brief, we solemnly betrothed you to
each other."</p>

<p>"I begin to remember it all now, only the little one's
name, which escapes my memory," smiled the young
man, as a vision of a tiny golden-haired beauty returned
to his mind from the past.</p>

<p>"But you were parted soon after that," continued Lady
Putnam. "My cousin returned to her American home, and
suffered a series of misfortunes. Her husband proved unfaithful,
and a divorce followed. She married within two
years a splendid gentleman&mdash;a Western millionaire&mdash;but
the happiness of her second union was destroyed by a terrible
trial. Her first husband stole away her lovely daughter,
little Geraldine, and all these years the most rigid
search has failed to find her, so that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother, mother, I beg your pardon for interrupting&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
said the girl's name was Geraldine," exclaimed
the young man, starting to his feet and betraying
for the first time an interest in the subject.</p>

<p>The utterance of that dear and beloved name&mdash;Geraldine&mdash;had
touched a vibrating chord in his sore heart, and he
waited in breathless eagerness for her reply.</p>

<p>Lady Putnam, not understanding his fiery impatience,
replied, placidly:</p>

<p>"Had you, indeed, forgotten the very name of your
dainty little American sweetheart, Leland? Yes, it was
Geraldine&mdash;Geraldine Harding."</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven!" and Lord Putnam sank back to his seat
the picture of surprise.</p>

<p>Here was a romance indeed!</p>

<p>It was, it must be, his own loved Geraldine of whom his
mother was telling him.</p>

<p>They had been betrothed from their very childhood, he
and pretty Geraldine. How sweet was the thought!</p>

<p>No wonder their hearts had leaped to greet each other
the first moment of their meeting in New York.</p>

<p>But the thought of the mystery that surrounded her
fate now forced a hollow groan from his lips.</p>

<p>"What is it, my son? You are not ill?" exclaimed Lady
Putnam, in alarm.</p>

<p>"No, no; it was only a passing twinge of pain. Do not
mind me, but go on, if you have any more to tell. But perhaps
your story is finished."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, for the best part is to come," smiled the
lady.</p>

<p>"The best part," he repeated, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes, for I have a letter from Florence Fitzgerald, my
cousin&mdash;the first letter in several years. I told you, did I
not, that since her second marriage she has lived in Chicago&mdash;that
great Western city where they held that wonderful
World's Fair, you know, Leland."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. I was there."</p>

<p>"Well, this letter from Chicago contains both good and
bad news. Florence has lost her good and kind husband,
and found her missing daughter."</p>

<p>"Found her daughter! Found Geraldine Harding!"
cried the young man, springing to his feet, in wild excitement.</p>

<p>"Yes, or Geraldine Fitzgerald, as she calls her now.
And, Leland, she will be a great heiress, for her mother's
large private fortune will be given to her eldest daughter,
as her second husband left her millions of money and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
perfect palace of a home on Prairie avenue, the grandest
location in the city."</p>

<p>She paused again in alarm, for this time her son had
fallen back in his chair, his face death-white, his eyes
half-closed.</p>

<p>Her words had been such a revelation to him that the
joy of it all overcame him.</p>

<p>He remembered instantly the day he had seen the beautiful
girl getting into the carriage before the artist's studio.</p>

<p>He had cried out that he knew her, but Ralph Washburn
had said it was Miss Fitzgerald, a great heiress.</p>

<p>So he supposed himself mistaken, and the cruel disappointment
had made him actually ill.</p>

<p>But now he knew that it was no mistake.</p>

<p>It was Geraldine herself that he had seen&mdash;dear, beautiful
Geraldine, his own betrothed, his heart's darling.</p>

<p>He cared nothing for what his mother had said about
her being a great heiress.</p>

<p>He loved her for herself alone, and he was rich enough
for both.</p>

<p>He would rather have had her remain poor, so that he
could have bestowed everything upon her himself.</p>

<p>But, oh, the joy of knowing that she was safe under her
mother's roof, safe where he could find her again&mdash;it made
him dizzy with such a rapture of joy and relief that his
face paled with emotion, and his eyes nearly closed, startling
Lady Putnam so that she sprang to his side, exclaiming,
in alarm:</p>

<p>"You are indeed ill, my dear boy, and I must send for a
physician. Please tell me in what way you are affected."</p>

<p>"It is my heart, dear mother!" he groaned, then caught
her around the waist, laughing: "Forgive me for alarming
you, dearest mother. I am not in the least ill; only overcome
with joy at hearing that my darling betrothed is
found again."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean it, Leland?" she inquired,
dubiously.</p>

<p>"Indeed I do mean it, and I can hardly wait for the time
when I shall return to America to claim my bonny bride."</p>

<p>She saw that a curious transformation had come over
him.</p>

<p>His cheeks were flushed, and his dark-blue eyes flashed
with joy.</p>

<p>She had never seen him look so radiantly happy.</p>

<p>But a sigh heaved her breast as she replied to his words:</p>

<p>"But I fear that I may never see her your bride, Leland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
for her mother owns in the letter that the girl has formed
an attachment for a poor young man she knew in New
York when she was only a poor salesgirl at O'Neill's store.
She clings stubbornly to this poor fireman, although she
has been told all about her betrothal to you."</p>

<p>"She repudiates my claim, eh?" he laughed, gayly.</p>

<p>"It seems so," she answered.</p>

<p>"Let me see the letter, please, mother."</p>

<p>She gave it to him, and although it covered many pages,
he read it with the deepest interest.</p>

<p>And no wonder, for he found there the story of all that
had happened to Geraldine since she had boarded the
train for Chicago with Clifford Standish. Mrs. Fitzgerald
had not failed to relate the discomfiture of the villain who
had kidnaped her daughter. Oh, the gladness of his heart
when he found how Geraldine had been saved from the
villain's power and restored to her mother's arms.</p>

<p>He knew that he could tell all his story to his mother
now, for Geraldine was proved pure and faithful; but a
moment's reflection decided him not to do so yet a while.</p>

<p>He had a romantic fancy to prove Geraldine's love to the
utmost, now that she had come into fortune and position.
Not as the Lord of Raneleigh would he woo her, but as
Harry Hawthorne, the fireman. Then he would know
the true value of her heart.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to return to America at once, his
impatience to see her was so great; but he remembered
that it would be almost impossible to do so now.</p>

<p>It was not yet two weeks since his father had been
buried, and his mother and sister were very sad and lonely.
They would be loath to have him leave them so soon.
Besides, as the new lord, there were matters to be seen to
that could scarcely admit of delay.</p>

<p>He remembered, too, that he had guests for whom he
had planned a tour to London and Paris. It would not
look well to desert them now. Business and hospitable duties
would detain him here at least two weeks longer before
he could return to America.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Geraldine was safe with her mother.</p>

<p>Standish, having received such a rebuff from Mrs.
Fitzgerald would naturally relinquish his pursuit as
hopeless. Indeed, the detective's news that the actor was
engaged in a flirtation with the governess had seemed to
be proof that he had given over his persecution of Geraldine.
He was off with the old love and on with the new.</p>

<p>So our hero, believing that everything was working together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
for his happiness, permitted himself to indulge in a
delightful conviction of security&mdash;a very mistaken one, as
the sequel will show.</p>

<p>Smiling fondly on his anxious mother, he said:</p>

<p>"Mother, I have a very romantic plan for winning my
pretty betrothed from her fireman lover, and I will explain
it to you soon. But you must not reply to Mrs. Fitzgerald's
letter until I give you leave."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Her ruby lips hiding teeth of pearl<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>Lady Putnam was delighted to find that her son was not
averse to the union with his fair American cousin.</p>

<p>Being an American herself, she had a fondness for her
old home and her old friends, especially her kinswoman,
Mrs. Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>So she heard with delight her son's avowal that he
would cut out the humble fireman in the regard of pretty
Geraldine.</p>

<p>She readily acceded to every condition he imposed on
her in the furtherance of his plans.</p>

<p>Their conference over, he went to seek his friends,
whom he found playing a game of billiards with his pretty
sister, Lady Amy.</p>

<p>The young Americans were both charmed with the
dainty beauty whose dark, curly tresses and laughing
blue eyes were so like those of her brother that they
showed their near kinship very plainly indeed.</p>

<p>The young lady herself was delighted with her brother's
friends. She could not have decided which one she liked
better.</p>

<p>When Leroy Hill, who was of a joyous, rollicking disposition,
would entertain her with witty anecdotes of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
he had seen, she would almost decide after all he was the
more interesting of the two, and perhaps the handsomer,
for his hazel eyes, with that twinkle of fun in them, were
irresistibly fascinating.</p>

<p>But, then, Ralph Washburn, who was of a more thoughtful
turn than his friend, and had large, serious, dark-gray
eyes, would read to her selections from favorite poets, or
sing to her in his rich, clear tenor, and the words would
sink deep into her heart, and she would find herself
musing:</p>

<p>"I almost like him better than Mr. Hill; but&mdash;I dare say
they are both sad flirts."</p>

<p>To-day Ralph had been quoting to her some verses from
a favorite poet of his own land, and as they gayly knocked
the balls about the table, they seemed to sing themselves
over persistently in her memory:</p>

<p>Since Ralph Washburn had repeated those lines to
piquant Lady Amy her eyes had been very shy when they
met his glance, hiding their light under the long-fringed
lashes, and he smiled when he saw that he had the power
to bring that bashful color to her cheek.</p>

<p>It took Lord Putnam but a few minutes to decide that
he would not confide to his friends yet the fact that Geraldine
was found. He did not want to jeopardize his plans
for winning her as simple Harry Hawthorne.</p>

<p>But at heart he was exceedingly anxious to return to
America, so he made his plans to begin to-morrow the
sight-seeing tour he had planned for Ralph and Leroy. In
a few weeks they could see and enjoy a great deal; then
he would be free to pursue his courtship of Geraldine. In
the meanwhile she would be safe with her mother, and if
her heart were disturbed by suspense over his fate, it
would only make it grow fonder, so that when they met
again it would only be to find a joyous welcome awaiting
him.</p>

</div></div>

<p>When her brother and his friends had gone up to London
it seemed very lonely to Lady Amy at Raneleigh.</p>

<p>"Mamma, I hope you will take me to America some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
for a long visit; I like Americans so much!" she cried,
artlessly.</p>

<p>"So do I," returned her mother, and then she sighed
softly to herself.</p>

<p>Who can tell what memories stirred her heart of days of
bellehood in New York, when, for plain ambition's sake,
she had put aside a plain, untitled lover to wed Lord Putnam
and reign at Castle Raneleigh? They had told her,
her maneuvering relatives, that love would be sure to
come after marriage.</p>

<p>"But what if I already love another?" the beautiful belle
had said, pale with anxiety.</p>

<p>"You will soon forget him on the other side of the ocean,
and Lord Putnam will have all your heart," they answered.</p>

<p>They were old in experience, and she was young, so she
took their advice, and married her titled lover. Perhaps
their assurances proved true, perhaps not. At any rate,
she was a faithful wife.</p>

<p>But she was not by any means a disconsolate widow.</p>

<p>And at her daughter's praise of Americans, the proud
woman's heart echoed every word, and her thoughts flew
across the sea to the old home, and the old days, and the
old love.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was dead now. She had not heard of him for
many years.</p>

<p>Or if he were not dead, he was probably married to another,
to some true-hearted girl who prized love above all
else.</p>

<p>There was a sting in the thought, and Lady Putnam
sighed and turned away without promising her daughter
to take her to America. She had no desire to return to the
scene of her old triumphs. She wanted sleeping memories
to keep still in the grave where they were buried.</p>

<p>"You are in luck, my boy," chuckled Clifford Standish,
to himself.</p>

<p>He had just read in a New York newspaper of the death
of his deserted wife.</p>

<p>No pity stirred his cruel heart as his eye ran over the
few paragraphs that told him in a sensational manner of
the cause of her death.</p>

<p>Deserted by her husband, in ill-health, and unable to
work, penniless, friendless, the unhappy woman had
frozen to death in a miserable attic-room during the
prevalence of a terrible blizzard.</p>

<p>He was guilty of her death, he knew, yet not one twinge
of remorse tore his cruel heart for the fate to which he
had consigned that true and tender wife.</p>

<p>She was out of his path forever, leaving him free to
carry out his wicked designs, and he rejoiced exceedingly.</p>

<p>Fate seemed to favor him, although for a while things
had looked exceedingly dark.</p>

<p>But that was when he had discovered that his murderous
knife-thrust had not killed Harry Hawthorne.</p>

<p>He had been terribly alarmed at first, fearing that Hawthorne
would set the authorities on his track, and that he
would have to fly the city.</p>

<p>But, for some unknown reason, his victim had stayed
his hand in vengeance, and by careful reconnoitering he
found that he had left the city.</p>

<p>Standish could not comprehend why his rival had
thrown up the game like this; but he finally concluded
that Geraldine's altered position in life had caused her to
break off her engagement with the young fireman.</p>

<p>But, whatever the cause, he rejoiced at the issue, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
prepared to take advantage of it by getting Geraldine
again into his power.</p>

<p>His passion for the beautiful girl and his determination
to possess her grew and strengthened from hour to hour
and from day to day. All he had felt for others in the past
compared to this grand passion, was</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As moonlight unto sunlight,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And as water unto wine."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And now he swore to himself that he would possess her
by a tie none could dispute. He would marry pretty Geraldine,
the dainty heiress, and teach her to love him.
Surely, he said to himself, out of his measureless conceit,
she could not find it hard to love him. She had been very
near to it once.</p>

<p>But in this fancy he was quite mistaken. His attentions
had simply flattered her girlish vanity. Her heart had not
been touched.</p>

<p>He waited impatiently for the letter from Miss Errol,
planning the kidnaping but it did not come.</p>

<p>The miserable woman, although distracted by fears for
her own safety, had not yet brought herself to the point
of consenting to become a party to Geraldine's ruin.</p>

<p>Every impulse in her woman's nature cried out against
doing such a cruel wrong to the fair young girl she admired
so much.</p>

<p>So she delayed replying to his letter, until, angered by
her delay, he wrote again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You have not replied to my letter. Of course you
know the terrible risk you run by your silence. But I will
give you one more chance.</p>

<p>"Will no answer ever come?" sighed Geraldine, as she
watched the papers, day after day, for an answer to her
personal.</p>

<p>"Hope deferred maketh the heart sick," it is said, and
her suspense was cruel and torturing. Not even Cissy's
presence could assuage her pain, although it was borne in
torturing silence.</p>

<p>One morning, while she was searching the newspaper
columns, as usual, her eyes gleamed with a sudden light
of pleasure, and she looked up at Cissy, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Only think, dear&mdash;the Clemens Company will begin a
week's engagement in Chicago to-morrow evening."</p>

<p>The quick color flew to Cissy's face, but she nodded with
apparent indifference.</p>

<p>Geraldine continued:</p>

<p>"They will play 'Laurel Vane.' Oh, do you remember
the night in New York when I played it, Cissy, and our
terrible interruption by the appearance of the men who
arrested Mr. Standish? I was very unhappy that night,
for I believed that Harry Hawthorne had married Daisy
Odell, as that wretch declared. Oh! how it all comes back
to me now&mdash;my jealous misery when I stood at the wings
watching you all in Mrs. Stansbury's box! But, oh, the
happiness that came to me later, when I learned the real
truth!"</p>

<p>She leaned her fair head down on Cissy's shoulder, and
sighed:</p>

<p>"No girl ever loved a man as fondly as I love my darling
Harry, and the mystery of his fate is breaking my
heart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald entered the library at that moment, and
Geraldine looked up quickly, saying:</p>

<p>"Mamma, cannot we have a box at the theatre to-morrow
night? There is a play that I specially wish to see."</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear, if I can find you some lady to
chaperon you and Cissy. You know I cannot accompany
you, because of my deep mourning."</p>

<p>The box was secured, and a chaperon found in the person
of a very old lady, a distant relative of the Fitzgeralds,
who had fallen into comparative poverty, but who would
enjoy the outing all the more since she could not well
afford to give herself the pleasure of a box, and was too
proud to use a low-priced seat.</p>

<p>The next evening found the three in their box at the
Columbia&mdash;Mrs. Germyn, the old lady, looking the chaperon
to the life in her black velvet and point lace, set off
by her silvery puffs of hair. The two young girls&mdash;Geraldine
in silvery-blue brocade and pearls, Cissy in white,
with gold ornaments and flowers&mdash;were the cynosure of
all eyes. Not a face in the crowded and fashionable audience
could compare with theirs in beauty.</p>

<p>When the curtain rose on the first act, it was not long
before the company discovered Geraldine and Cissy in
the nearest box. They were surprised and mystified, for
no whisper of Geraldine's good fortune had reached her
old associates. It had been whispered about that she had
eloped with the missing actor, Clifford Standish, and some
had pitied and others condemned.</p>

<p>So many and curious were the glances that went from
the stage to the box where beautiful Geraldine was sitting,
robed like some princess, in all the trappings of
wealth and state.</p>

<p>The young girl enjoyed it thoroughly, and presently she
whispered to her friend:</p>

<p>"I'm going to send a message to Cameron Clemens to
come to our box at the first wait. You won't mind, will
you?"</p>

<p>Cissy's heart leaped quickly under the lace and flowers
of her corsage.</p>

<p>"Oh, Geraldine, you know I do not wish to meet him,"
she whispered back, while the half-deaf old chaperon lent
both her ears to the play.</p>

<p>"Cissy, you are the proudest girl I ever saw! How can
you be so cruel to poor Mr. Clemens? You are as much in
fault as ever he was, for I am sure that nothing stands
between your hearts now but your own abominable pride."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Geraldine, how can you jump at things so? I dare
say he has forgotten me now, and is in love with some
other lady&mdash;that beautiful leading lady, Miss Mills, for
instance."</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Mills has a husband whom she fairly adores.
You needn't be jealous of her, darling. So I'm going to
invite Mr. Clemens into our box to talk to us. You needn't
be friendly with him if you don't choose. I'll introduce
you as the veriest stranger, if you wish."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered Cissy, for she knew that the
willful beauty would have her own way.</p>

<p>Geraldine's romantic heart was set on the reconciliation
of the two long estranged lovers; so she sent the message
at once, and Mr. Clemens came to the box at the end of
the first act.</p>

<p>"Aren't you surprised to see me here, Mr. Clemens?"
cried Geraldine, shaking hands with him cordially, then
presenting her friends: "Mrs. Germyn, and my friend
from New York. Miss Carroll, Mr. Clemens."</p>

<p>The estranged lovers, both pale as ashes, bowed to each
other like strangers, without a sign that they had met
before to-night.</p>

</p>


<p>Geraldine watched the meeting between the estranged
lovers with a knowing little smile.</p>

<p>Their sudden pallor and emotion, even the constraint of
their meeting, assured her that love was not dead in their
hearts.</p>

<p>The ashes still smoldered, and needed but a breath to
blow them into flame again.</p>

<p>Geraldine loved Cissy so dearly that she longed to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the girl to happiness again, and she determined to leave
nothing undone to reconcile her to her lover.</p>

<p>When they were seated again, she said, brightly:</p>

<p>"You must promise to call on me to-morrow, for I have
dozens of questions to ask you, and much to tell you, and
I know you will not have time to listen to it now."</p>

<p>"I will come with the greatest pleasure," he replied, his
handsome face glowing with delight, for he guessed that
at her home he should meet Cissy again.</p>

<p>Geraldine understood his thought, and said, quickly:</p>

<p>"Miss Carroll is staying with me for an indefinite period,
and I mean to give her a good time in Chicago. Perhaps
you remember that we roomed together in New York
when we were both working-girls?"</p>

<p>He smiled affirmatively, and she continued:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have not heard that I have found my lost
mother since I left New York?"</p>

<p>"No; is it true? Let me congratulate you," he cried,
warmly, and then Geraldine ran over her adventures
briefly, for she knew that he must soon leave her to return
to his duties.</p>

<p>"But I shall come back at the end of the second act,"
he said, as he hurried away.</p>

<p>He was with them every minute he could spare, and
Cissy was very angry with herself, for the traitorous
throbbing of her heart told her so plainly how dear he
was to her yet, in spite of the years in which she had been
teaching her heart to forget him.</p>

<p>He was amazed when he heard the story of Clifford
Standish's wickedness.</p>

<p>"I knew the man had a bad heart&mdash;his desertion of his
wife proved that&mdash;but I did not dream he would go to
such lengths as you tell me. What must have been your
fate had you not met your mother so opportunely?" he exclaimed
to Geraldine.</p>

<p>"What, indeed!" she shuddered, and then a low cry
from Cissy made her turn her head.</p>

<p>"Look! there is the wretch now!" cried Cissy, excitedly.</p>

<p>They followed her glance, and saw the face of Clifford
Standish peering at them from behind a pillar in the orchestra
circle.</p>

<p>When their indignant eyes turned on him, he realized
that he was being observed, and hastily dodged from sight.</p>

<p>They saw him no more that evening, but when they left
the theatre he was near enough to have touched Geraldine
with his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>He had come to the theatre from his interview with
Miss Erroll, and had triumphed over her bitterest prejudices
by representing that his wife was dead, and that he
really meant to marry Geraldine once he got her into his
power.</p>

<p>"I will teach her to love me after marriage," he boasted;
and the poor governess, who had once loved him madly,
and was still somewhat under the glamour of that old
passion, did not doubt his power to win Geraldine's heart.
She knew how fascinating he could be when he chose.</p>

<p>For one moment, indeed, a jealous pang tore her heart,
and she said, pleadingly:</p>

<p>"If your wife is dead, as you say, Clifford, you ought to
marry me. You owe it to me, after all I gave up for your
sake. You know I trusted in your promises."</p>

<p>"You were a fool for your pains," he replied, with
brutal frankness. "You had knowledge enough of the
world to be sure that a silly married woman who deserts
her husband for another man will surely reap what she
has sown."</p>

<p>"You swore you would marry me when Cameron
Clemens secured a divorce."</p>

<p>"You were very silly to believe me, Azuba. I was only
amusing myself with your credulity. A man never means
the vows he makes in an affair of that kind. The time is
sure to come when he will meet some pure young girl, and
give her the best of his heart. Then he despises the weak
victims of his past passions."</p>

<p>"As you despise me?" she demanded, bitterly.</p>

<p>"It would not be polite to say so," he replied, indifferently,
and hearing her stifled sob, he added, impatiently:
"Bah, Azuba! I have quite got over my old fancy for you,
and your sniveling cannot warm over the old coals. I
never really loved you&mdash;never knew the power of love
until I met pretty Geraldine, and the only way for you to
get a kind thought from me is to help me to win the little
beauty."</p>

<p>Crushed and humiliated by his scorn, she would have
defied him if she had dared, but she was in his power, and
dared not do it; so, ere they parted, the plot for Geraldine's
abduction was made, and nothing remained but to
carry it out that night.</p>

<p>"Do not dare to fail me, or the weight of my vengeance
will crush you," he said, threateningly, and with a shudder
she promised to obey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>They parted, and he hurried to the theatre, where she
had told him Geraldine had gone.</p>

<p>Securing a seat in the orchestra circle, in the desirable
concealment of a pillar, he alternately watched the heiress
and the play.</p>

<p>An angry sneer curled his lips as he saw the new leading
man in the play was even superior to himself in the
role of the hero.</p>

<p>"So I can never get back my position in that company,"
he mused. "Well, no matter! I shall marry the heiress,
and if the old woman cuts up rough and won't give us any
of her daughter's money, we can go on the stage, and the
elopement will be an advertisement for us."</p>

<p>As he watched Geraldine in all her beauty, sitting with
her friends, his passion for her grew deeper, and he mentally
hugged himself at the thought of how soon he would
have her in his power.</p>

<p>When her carriage rolled away, and he noted the lingering
glance sent after it by Cameron Clemens, he sneered,
grimly:</p>

<p>"Bah! what fools love makes of us all! There is Clemens
as madly in love with that hateful Cissy Carroll as I am
with pretty Geraldine. He has been in love with her ever
since Azuba Aylesford forced them apart, to marry him
herself. Egad! I did them a good turn when I flattered
Mrs. Clemens into eloping with me; and if the Carroll girl
ever gets him back she may thank me for ridding him of
his incumbrance, though she hates me like poison!"</p>

<p>He turned away with a harsh laugh, and went his way
through the gloomy shadows of the winter night, like a
thing of evil omen.</p>

<p>And in all that vast city of Chicago where crime stalks
abroad under the cover of darkness, there was not a soul
more lost to goodness than that of this man.</p>

</p>


<p>Cameron Clemens had indeed gazed with longing eyes
after the carriage that bore Miss Carroll away from his
sight.</p>

<p>The old love, stifled so long by hopeless pain and absence,
had leaped to life again full-grown within his fond
heart.</p>

<p>And although Cissy had been painfully shy, seldom
speaking to him, and then only in her role of a new acquaintance,
he had read in her glance that she did not despise
him now. Something had come over her that looked
almost like forgiveness of his fault. He began to have a
little hope of winning her after all.</p>

<p>"I will try my fate once more, if she is as gentle when
we meet again as she was to-night," he resolved, joyously.</p>

<p>He could not sleep that night for thinking of Cissy's
looks and words, and wondering if he should see her to-morrow
when he called on Geraldine.</p>

<p>"I shall ask for her also, and then she can have no excuse
for not seeing me," he resolved, firmly.</p>

<p>The next afternoon, at the earliest permissible hour, he
presented himself at the door of Mrs. Fitzgerald's magnificent
house, and sent in his cards for the two young ladies.</p>

<p>He was ushered into a dainty reception-room, fitted in
blue, and waited with what patience he could for their
appearance.</p>

<p>Presently the heavy portieres were swept aside by a
plump, dimpled white hand, and Miss Carroll entered the
room alone.</p>

<p>Cameron Clemens sprang to meet her, thinking that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
had never looked more lovely in her becoming house gown
of delicate blue, with lace and ribbons fluttering about it.</p>

<p>He offered his hand, and as she placed hers in it he saw
a delicate pinkness about her eyelids that betrayed recent
tears.</p>

<p>Pointing to a seat, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Isn't it surprising? Or&mdash;have you not heard?"</p>

<p>"I have heard nothing, Miss Carroll. Pray enlighten
me."</p>

<p>"It is about Geraldine, you know."</p>

<p>"You do not mean that she is ill?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no&mdash;not ill. You remember how well she was
last night. Well, after we came home Geraldine eloped,"
and the last word was almost a sob, for Cissy was terribly
agitated.</p>

<p>A terrible fear came to him, and he faltered:</p>

<p>"Not with Standish?"</p>

<p>Cissy flashed her adorer a reproachful glance, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Didn't Geraldine tell you last night how
she hated and despised that wretch? She ran away to
marry Harry Hawthorne, her betrothed, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've heard of him&mdash;fine fellow, they say. Tell
me all about it."</p>

<p>"There isn't much to tell. Geraldine's mother was opposed
to the match, because Mr. Hawthorne was poor. So
this morning Geraldine was missing, and there was a note
on her pillow, saying that she had gone away with her
darling Harry, and they would be married right away.
She hoped her mother would forgive her, as she (Geraldine)
could not live without her dear boy."</p>

<p>"Plucky girl!" was Mr. Clemens' comment, and Cissy
continued:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fitzgerald is almost heart-broken, and very angry,
too. She declares that she will never forgive her daughter."</p>

<p>"Is she so proud?" he asked, drawing his chair a little
closer.</p>

<p>Cissy noticed the movement, and blushed prettily as she
replied:</p>

<p>"As proud as a queen. But yet she is a magnificent woman,
and I sympathize with her in her sorrow."</p>

<p>Before he could reply, there was an interruption, the
cause of which we must explain.</p>

<p>Little Miss Claire, the pet and darling of the household,
had run away from her governess in a willful mood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
hidden herself where she could not be found. Miss Erroll,
searching every room in turn for her naughty pupil, blundered
suddenly upon the pair of lovers in the blue reception-room.</p>

<p>Cameron Clemens heard the sweep of her robe, and
glanced hurriedly up.</p>

<p>The next moment he was upon his feet.</p>

<p>"You! You!" he burst out, with instant recognition,
and in a tone of defiant hate.</p>

<p>It seemed to him in that startling moment, that Azuba
Aylesford, the imperious actress, had come again, as she
did years ago, to part him from his love, sweet Cissy.</p>

<p>She, on her own part, was so dazed by this unexpected
rencontre, that for a moment she stood motionless, rooted
to the ground by fear.</p>

<p>Cameron Clemens, gazing at her with eyes full of loathing,
continued:</p>

<p>"How dared you follow me here? You have no claim on
me now, nor ever can have again. I loathe you!"</p>

<p>His words assured both listeners that he thought the woman
had followed him here to work evil to him, and with
this explanation Miss Erroll's trance of terror gave way.
She sprang to Cissy's side, pleading:</p>

<p>"Oh, for Heaven's sake! explain it all to him! He would
not listen to me, I know, but he loves you. He will listen
if you tell him the truth, and beg him not to betray me."</p>

<p>Cissy was paling and flushing alternately, as she sprang
up, and said, tremblingly, to her lover:</p>

<p>"She did not follow you here. She is a member of this
household&mdash;governess to Miss Fitzgerald's children. She is
living an honest life, and would not wish her antecedents
to be brought up against her now."</p>

<p>He answered, angrily:</p>

<p>"Why should either of us spare her now? She wronged
us both, most bitterly, in the past, and did not scruple
afterward to throw a blighting disgrace on my life."</p>

<p>"But I left you free to seek happiness with the woman
you loved, so I did you a good turn after all, Cameron
Clemens. You never loved me, and you did not grieve for
me. You have even been friendly with the man who lured
me from you!" Miss Erroll cried, eagerly.</p>

<p>He knew that much of her charge was true. He could
deny only the last of it.</p>

<p>"Not friendly," he said, "for we had a bitter quarrel
once. But he told me you had fled from him, refusing to
become his wife, after I obtained my divorce. You were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
untrue to both of us. So why should we become enemies
for the sake of a worthless woman?"</p>

<p>How she shivered with shame under the stinging contempt
of his tones, for some womanhood lurked in her
still, and she knew that she was not quite so black as she
was painted.</p>

<p>But as she quailed before his righteous wrath, Cissy
came generously to the rescue, her gray eyes dark with
emotion, her cheeks suffused with blushes.</p>

<p>"Hush! do not utterly crush her with your scorn!" she
cried. "Clifford Standish lied to you, the perjured villain!
She did not refuse to marry him. He told her he had a
wife already, and was tired of his liaison, so she fled from
him in horror at her terrible position. She has been trying
to lead a good life ever since, and we must not throw
her back into temptation. I have forgiven her, and promised
to keep her secret, and so must you."</p>

<p>Cissy paused for breath, and her lover looked at her
adoringly.</p>

<p>Never had she looked so beautiful, never had she seemed
so truly noble as at this moment when so generously
pleading the cause of the woman who had brought such
bitter sorrow into her life.</p>

<p>He forgot for a moment the tall, fair, beautiful woman
who hung breathlessly on his fiat of fate, and exclaimed,
rapturously:</p>

<p>"Cissy, you are an angel!"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is an angel!" cried the governess, eagerly.
"She is an angel, and she will forgive you all your faults
and make you happy yet&mdash;so happy that you might afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
to spare the poor wretch whose sins have all recoiled upon
her own head with crushing weight!"</p>

<p>"Spare her!" pleaded Cissy, with humid eyes.</p>

<p>He looked back at her tenderly, and answered:</p>

<p>"For your sake!"</p>

<p>With a sob of joy, the governess fled from the room.</p>

<p>And with her going the last shadow that her wicked influence
had cast upon their lives faded into the past.</p>

<p>He moved closer to Cissy, catching both her trembling
hands in his, and looking deep into her tearful eyes, saying,
tremulously:</p>

<p>"My darling, the events of to-day have thrown down
the last barriers of restraint between us, and we are back
again where we left off that bitter day when you cast me
off for the sake of the woman who declared she had a better
claim to me. Cannot we go back to that past?"</p>

<p>Her face was downcast, her eyes drooped from his, she
trembled, and did not speak.</p>

<p>But he was not repulsed, for she let him keep the little
trembling hands in his, and he was thus encouraged to go
on in a low voice, hoarse from passionate love:</p>

<p>"Cissy, I love you more devotedly than ever, and I
should have sought you long ago but that I feared a repulse.
I knew so well your willful pride, you see. But
now fate has thrown us together again, and it will break
my heart to lose this new sweet hope. Darling, will you
forgive the past, and let the future make amends?"</p>

<p>Cissy had not thought last night that she would be won
so quickly as this. She had resolved in her heart to be
quite cold at first, and make her lover's second wooing
very difficult.</p>

<p>But as Cameron said, the events of the day had made
reserve impossible. They had come face to face with the
past in all its love and pain.</p>

<p>So she could not steel her responsive heart to her lover's
impetuous wooing. With a great burst of tears that revealed
all her heart, she threw herself into his eager arms
that clasped and held her with boundless delight.</p>

<p>And the woman whom Cissy had saved from exposure
by her generous prayer for mercy, crept away to her room,
muttering, in a fearful way:</p>

<p>"How strangely fate pursues me in this house! I thought
I was done with my bitter past, but three of its ghosts
have risen here to confront me with my sins! What a terrible
blunder I made going into that room! But I did not
dream of meeting my divorced husband there! Still, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
might have guessed he would follow that girl, the one
love of his life. She is indeed an angel, but alas! she would
not intercede for me if she knew the thing I had done last
night!"</p>

<p>The strange disappearance of her daughter had come to
Mrs. Fitzgerald with the suddenness of a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>To lose her like this&mdash;the child she had loved so dearly
and mourned so unceasingly&mdash;over whom she had rejoiced
with such yearning love when found; oh! it was inexpressibly
bitter!</p>

<p>In the six weeks that Geraldine had been with her the
glad mother had lavished on her daughter everything that
could make a young girl happy, withholding nothing except
her approval of her love for Harry Hawthorne. Wealth
had been poured out with an unstinting hand, to surround
her and clothe her with beautiful things; she had been
praised, petted, and loved by the whole household, and
the two children, her half-brother and sister, had vied
with each other in lovely attentions to their new-found
sister.</p>

<p>Nothing had been lacking to make Geraldine happy&mdash;nothing
except the love she had been forbidden to cherish.</p>

<p>Alas! this love had ranked above everything else in her
tender heart.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The world is naught when one is gone<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who was the world? then the heart breaks<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That this is lost which was once won."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mother's heart was cruelly wounded by the desertion
of her daughter.</p>

<p>"I will never forgive her!" she cried in the first agony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of the shock. "She has proved herself the child of her
wicked father by this heartless desertion of home and
friends, and I can realize how little of my blood runs
in the veins of the daughter I bore him."</p>

<p>In vain did Cissy intercede for her friend.</p>

<p>"Remember how young and loving she was, dear Mrs.
Fitzgerald. Then, too, her lover was very charming&mdash;just
the sort of a man to fascinate a young girl."</p>

<p>"He may have been as handsome as Apollo, and as fascinating,
but he was not a good man, or he would never
have persuaded a young girl to elope with him. Why did
he not come frankly to me like a gentleman, and ask for
my daughter's hand?"</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Fitzgerald, because he knew it would be
hopeless. Of course our dear Geraldine must have acquainted
him with your opposition to the marriage," said
Cissy, gently, though in her heart she thought very
strangely of Geraldine, asking herself over and over why
the girl had chosen to deceive her so in asserting that she
knew nothing of Hawthorne's whereabouts.</p>

<p>"She must have been in secret correspondence with him
all the while, but I could not have believed it of Geraldine
but for that note in her own writing," she said, sadly
enough to the angry mother.</p>

<p>At first, Mrs. Fitzgerald had feared that Cissy was in
the plot of Geraldine's elopement, but the young girl's
surprise and grief were so genuine that she dismissed the
doubt. "She has treated you shamefully, too, my dear,"
said the lady. "After inviting you here as a guest, and
promising you such a charming time, it was abominable
to go off that way and leave you in the lurch."</p>

<p>"Do not worry about me. My only concern is for you in
your trouble. Geraldine acted willfully, I know, but there
is one comfort. The man she has married is good and true,
and cannot fail to make her happy."</p>

<p>"Ah, but, my dear girl, only think of what she has
thrown away. Why, Geraldine was betrothed to a nobleman
from her childhood, the owner of a vast estate in
England."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that was why she ran away for fear of being
forced into an unloving marriage, madame."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, that would never have happened, of course. I
would not have wished her to marry unwillingly, nor
would noble Lord Putnam have accepted an unloving
bride. Perhaps, after all, he will wait for my Claire. She
will be grown up in a few years, and bids fair to be as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
lovely as Geraldine," returned the lady, comforting herself
with hopes of the future.</p>

<p>At that moment a servant entered the boudoir to announce
the arrival of Cameron Clemens.</p>

<p>Cissy looked up with heightened color, saying:</p>

<p>"It is a gentleman we knew in New York. If you will
excuse me, I will go down, and I will be glad to have you
accompany me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald protested that she was not able to see
any one, and excused herself to Cissy, who hurried down
to the caller.</p>

<p>We have read in a former chapter of the result of that
interview, so we will follow Cissy, after his departure,
back to the presence of Mrs. Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>"I fear I shall have to return to New York in a few
days," she remarked, feeling that delicacy would suggest
her leaving after Geraldine's strange desertion.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Fitzgerald raised an indignant protest.</p>

<p>"No, Cissy, you must not go. I have grown very fond of
you, and why should you not remain with me?"</p>

<p>Cissy thanked her for her cordiality, but said, blushingly,
that she must go back to work. She was to be married
in the spring, and she must earn her wedding clothes.</p>

<p>"Married? Oh, dear! And to the gentleman who was
calling just now, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame," owned Cissy, with the loveliest rose
glowing on her soft cheeks.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it!" cried the lady, kindly.</p>

<p>Cissy thought that this would involve too long a story,
so she said, simply, that she and Mr. Clemens had been
engaged years before, and had quarreled and parted. Now
they had made it up again, and she had promised to marry
him in the spring.</p>

<p>"I have a charming thought," cried the lady. "You
shall not return to New York. Stay with me as my companion
and friend, and be married here."</p>

<p>"My dear lady, you are too kind&mdash;but it would be impossible.
There is my trousseau to be thought of, you
know."</p>

<p>"Certainly, child. I was thinking of that. Leave it to me
to provide the trousseau as my wedding gift to you.
What? Too proud? Why, aren't you to be my companion?
And, of course, I shall owe you as much as you could earn
at O'Neill's&mdash;and more," softly. "My dear girl, don't refuse.
Think how unhappy I am, and what a comfort you
can be to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Cissy saw that the offer was affectionate and earnest,
and came from the depths of a noble heart, so she accepted
it most gladly.</p>

<p>The days came and went, until it was almost two weeks
since Geraldine's elopement.</p>

<p>They had looked every day for a letter from her, telling
them where she was, and perhaps pleading for pardon,
and to be permitted to see her mother again.</p>

<p>But not a line was received from the truant.</p>

<p>"She is cruel, heartless! her father's child, not mine,"
cried poor Mrs. Fitzgerald, trying to steel her heart against
the truant.</p>

<p>But one cold, snowy day toward the last of February&mdash;could
they ever forget that day&mdash;a card was brought to
the lady in her boudoir.</p>

<p>She glanced at it, and turned deadly pale.</p>

<p>The card bore a name she had reason to hate.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Harry Hawthorne.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It fell from her trembling hands, and Cissy, glancing
at it, exclaimed, joyously:</p>

<p>"We shall hear of Geraldine at last!"</p>

<p>"I cannot see him!" moaned Mrs. Fitzgerald, tremblingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you will. Come! I will go down with you.
Courage! You will fall in love with your son-in-law at
sight, and forgive him for stealing your daughter!" cried
Cissy, encouragingly, taking her hand to lead her down.</p>

<p>And in a few more moments they stood in the presence
of a man so strikingly handsome and debonair that Mrs.
Fitzgerald could not help from thawing toward him a
little as Cissy presented him. He was well-dressed, princely
in manners and appearance. As far as looks and culture
went, her favorite, Lord Putnam, could not surpass the
New York fireman.</p>

<p>He looked disappointed somehow, and after the first few
words were passed, ventured straight to the point.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fitzgerald, I think your daughter has told you of
me. We are betrothed, you know, and I hope her heart
has not turned against me with her accession to fortune.
May I hope that you will also smile on my suit, and permit
me to see Geraldine?"</p>

<p>They stared at him in amazement, the two startled women.
Why, what could he mean, with those strange words
and that confident air?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Cissy recovered from her trance of surprise first, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Mr. Hawthorne, what can you mean? Geraldine is not
here. We supposed she was with you!"</p>

<p>"With me?&mdash;how strange! Why, Miss Carroll, I haven't
seen her since Christmas Eve. Do not tell me that harm
has come to my darling!"</p>

<p>Harry Hawthorne had sprung to his feet, pale with
emotion, as he stood before Cissy, repeating the words:</p>

<p>"With me? How strange! Why, I have not seen her
since Christmas. Do not tell me that harm has come to my
darling!"</p>

<p>With the utterance of his words a terrible comprehension
dawned on Mrs. Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>She understood that she had been horribly deceived, that
Geraldine had not gone away to marry her lover, but had
been entrapped into some terrible fate.</p>

<p>The fear of Clifford Standish's vengeance for the scorn
she had heaped on him pierced her heart like a knife-thrust.</p>

<p>For two weeks Geraldine had been missing.</p>

<p>And no search had been made, because it was believed
that she was safe and happy with her heart's choice,
Harry Hawthorne.</p>

<p>But, instead, she had become the victim of a terrible
doom.</p>

<p>The horror of her apprehensions overcame the mother's
heart, and she fell forward in a heavy swoon.</p>

<p>When consciousness returned, she found herself lying
flat on a couch, with Cissy bathing her forehead, and
Hawthorne her hands, with <i>eau de cologne</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>She felt very weak and helpless, but as consciousness
returned to her she groaned despairingly.</p>

<p>Hawthorne gave her a look of tender sympathy, and
said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fitzgerald, can you listen to me a few moments?"</p>

<p>His gentle voice and manly looks inclined her heart
toward him in spite of her prejudices against him, so she
bowed her head affirmatively.</p>

<p>He went on:</p>

<p>"While we were trying to restore you to consciousness,
Miss Carroll has told me the circumstances of Geraldine's
disappearance. That note purporting to be from Geraldine
was no doubt a forgery, and I fear she has fallen into the
power of Clifford Standish."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald groaned. Cissy sobbed aloud, and although
Hawthorne would not permit himself to break
down like a woman, his voice was very husky as he proceeded:</p>

<p>"A few more words and I must leave you, to institute a
search for our missing darling. Will you bid me Godspeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes," and she held out her hand to him voluntarily.</p>

<p>When he took it he felt a warm, kindly pressure, and
realized that in their common loss and sorrow humanity
had triumphed over pride, and he could count on her as a
true friend. Lord Putnam was momentarily forgotten.</p>

<p>Releasing her hand, he added:</p>

<p>"You may wonder at my delay in seeking Geraldine, so
I will briefly explain: In the first place, when I found that
the actor had abducted her on Christmas evening, I followed
on the next train to Chicago. Four weary days I
sought her, but all in vain. At length I met Standish one
cold snowy evening on an obscure street, and demanded
Geraldine at his hands. He assured me with such malice,
that she was his willing companion, that I sprang at the
dastard's throat in fury, and he stabbed me and ran off,
leaving me for dead. Some kind Samaritans rescued and
took care of me, but I kept the name of my would-be
murderer a secret, for fear of drawing Geraldine's name
into a scandal. Well, just as I became convalescent, I received
news of the death of a very near relative that
obliged my immediate return to New York. I sent for a detective,
confided my secrets to him, and employed him to
search for Geraldine in my absence. While I was away I
received information that Geraldine had discovered her
long-lost mother, and was safe with you. As this set my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
mind at rest about my betrothed, I paid and dismissed my
detective, and determined that as soon as I had settled up
some business matters I had on hand, I would return to
Chicago and ascertain whether Geraldine's heart had remained
true to me in her change of fortune, or if she
would discard me for some richer lover. I arrived to-day,
and came here full of hope and love to meet&mdash;this terrible
tragedy of woe!"</p>

<p>He paused to steady his shaking voice, then added:</p>

<p>"But I believe I have a clew, and I shall follow it up. I
go now to my detective. He is very clever, and I am very
sorry I dismissed him. I feel sure he can help me to unravel
this mystery."</p>

<p>The hope and courage in his voice inspired her to exclaim,
eagerly:</p>

<p>"May Heaven help you&mdash;and bless you!"</p>

<p>"Thank you! Those words will inspire me to do my
best."</p>

<p>He touched her hand with his lips, like a gallant knight,
and bowing to Cissy, left the room.</p>

<p>But while Mrs. Fitzgerald lay unconscious, he had said
to the young girl:</p>

<p>"Is there a governess in this house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Erroll."</p>

<p>"Has she ever carried on a flirtation with Standish?"</p>

<p>To his surprise, Cissy blushed, and stammered, replying:</p>

<p>"I should not like to answer that question unless you
have very good cause for asking it."</p>

<p>She was generously eager to shield the woman's past if
she could consistently do so.</p>

<p>But he answered, gravely:</p>

<p>"This must be considered a secret yet, but my detective
wrote me that Mr. Standish was carrying on a flirtation
with this Miss Erroll. Can she have been in collusion with
him to kidnap Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"Good Heaven!" cried Cissy, paling at the awful suspicion
that presented itself. She saw that she must tell all
she knew.</p>

<p>But at that moment Mrs. Fitzgerald showed signs of reviving,
and Cissy whispered, hurriedly:</p>

<p>"I can tell you all about Miss Erroll and Standish. They
were lovers long ago, but I do not know if they have met
recently."</p>

<p>Then the lady opened her eyes, and the subject dropped.</p>

<p>But when Hawthorne was gone, the horror of his suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
staid in Cissy's mind, and she admitted to herself
that it might be plausible.</p>

<p>For what if Standish, by threatening the woman with
betrayal to her employer, had forced her to help him in
his nefarious plot?</p>

<p>Cissy was so excited and indignant that she was on the
point of rushing to Miss Erroll and taxing her with the
crime.</p>

<p>But sober second thought restrained her.</p>

<p>She might frighten the woman, and cause her to run
away out of reach.</p>

<p>She decided to leave it all to Hawthorne and the detective.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, she had enough on her hands to soothe the
agonized mother, who was almost frantic with grief over
the mystery of her daughter's fate.</p>

<p>She kept wringing her hands and sobbing:</p>

<p>"It is two long weeks since she disappeared. Oh, it is
too late! too late! for any one to save my poor child now!"</p>

<p>Cissy shuddered at all that the words implied, but she
cried, bravely:</p>

<p>"Do not let us despair. Although Geraldine's whereabouts
are unknown to us, she is in the keeping of God, as
she has always been, and surely He will protect her. Let
us hope and pray."</p>

<p>Gradually she infused some hope into the mother's
heart, and presently they knelt and prayed to God to restore
Geraldine to their arms again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hawthorne, as we will continue to call him
for a little while, hurried to the office of Norris, the wonderful
Western detective.</p>

<p>He found the little man in, and after a hurried greeting,
said:</p>

<p>"I have called again about that case of mine."</p>

<p>"Ah, you wish to begin another search for the girl; is
that it? I thought it strange you dropped it so suddenly
when you got my report. But perhaps you had received
news some way of the girl?"</p>

<p>"I had; but, Norris, that was a terrible mistake of mine
letting you drop the case when you did. You were on the
right track, though you did not know it. I am almost hoping
you kept on watching, out of curiosity, after I paid
and dismissed you. It will be worth much to you if you
did," anxiously.</p>

<p>"But I did not, I'm sorry to say; for directly after I got
your check I went off on a chase down South after some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
gold-brick swindlers. Fact is, I just got back from Richmond
yesterday, after a stay of three weeks. But I ran the
rascals down, though, after a very exciting chase. Tell
you all about it," bustled the little detective, importantly.</p>

<p>"No, I don't care about it now," Hawthorne cried, impatiently.
"You must hear my story first, for you must
never pause now till that missing girl is found&mdash;the girl
who was right under your nose all the time while you were
watching the governess&mdash;Miss Fitzgerald, formerly Geraldine
Harding."</p>

<p>"You don't say! Tell me all about it, sir."</p>

<p>Hawthorne went rapidly over all he had to tell, and then
Norris said:</p>

<p>"The governess helped him, as sure as you're born, Mr.
Daly."</p>

</div></div>


<p>It would scarcely be believed that a young girl could be
drugged and carried from her own room at midnight by a
scoundrel, even in the great, wicked city of Chicago.</p>

<p>But such had been the fate of our pretty Geraldine,
although only by the connivance of the governess had
Standish been able to accomplish the daring abduction.</p>

<p>Having quieted her uneasy scruples by swearing that he
meant to marry the girl&mdash;which, indeed, he was most
anxious to do&mdash;Standish unfolded his nefarious plot, and
by his threatenings forced her to consent to aid him.</p>

<p>He told her that the girl had flirted most outrageously
with him once, then thrown him over for another, and he
was determined to get even with the little jilt by making
her his wife. He swore that nothing should turn him from
his purpose of revenge, and unless Miss Erroll aided him
in this he would send Mrs. Fitzgerald a letter on the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
day, acquainting her with the past history of her
handsome governess.</p>

<p>It was absolutely fiendish, his threat, but she doubted
not that he would keep his word; so, promising all he
asked, she hurried away from him, eager to escape the
nipping winter blasts and the flecks of snow that kissed
her cheeks with icy lips, the forerunner of a snow-storm
that wrapped the earth in a snowy mantle long before the
dawn.</p>

<p>When the young ladies returned from the theatre, Miss
Erroll was bending over her desk, where she had been
busy for hours, counterfeiting Geraldine's handwriting
from a bit of manuscript she had stolen from her room.</p>

<p>She was an adept at this work, and succeeded in her task
so well that the note she pinned on Geraldine's pillow
somewhat later, was so cleverly done it might have deceived
an expert.</p>

<p>When Geraldine went into her own room that night she
found Miss Erroll waiting for her, instead of the neat mulatto
girl her mother had employed for her exclusive service.</p>

<p>"Martha was called home by the illness of her mother,
and begged me to help you if she did not return in time,"
she explained, smilingly.</p>

<p>The truth was that Miss Erroll had given the girl some
drugged wine that sent her into such a heavy sleep that
she was enabled to steal into her place.</p>

<p>Geraldine protested that she could do without assistance,
but Miss Erroll insisted on remaining; so at last she
was hurried into bed, and then the woman said, solicitously:</p>

<p>"Now a sip of this spiced wine the maid told me to keep
warm for you, to prevent a cold after being out such an
inclement evening."</p>

<p>Geraldine did not care for the wine, and she was not at
all chilly, but she drank a little from the cup, just to escape
the woman's importunities.</p>

<p>Then she laid her fair head down to rest, and in a very
few moments was soundly asleep; and no wonder, for the
wine she had drank had contained enough opium to keep
her in a stupor for many hours.</p>

<p>Not till she was sound asleep did the woman go out, and
then she stole like a shadow of evil omen through the darkened
house, where she undid all the door fastenings, that
Clifford Standish might have no difficulty in entering.</p>

<p>Returning to Geraldine's room, she cautiously dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the sleeping girl in warm, thick shoes and stockings, and
a thick blanket-wrapper, placing close at hand a heavy
cloak and hood, evidently making her ready for a mysterious
journey.</p>

<p>In the dressing-room beyond, she had already packed a
hand-bag with clothing, which she now brought in and
placed near the door.</p>

<p>While she was dressing her, Geraldine had stirred and
moaned several times, but the influence of the drug held
her senses bound too fast for her to awake; so Miss Erroll
had everything ready, and was crouched in a chair waiting,
when there came a low, soft scratching at the door,
the signal agreed on between them.</p>

<p>She started, growing pale as ashes, her heart sinking in
her breast. She had been hoping and praying that he
would not come.</p>

<p>Stealing to the door, she admitted Standish, who was
not a very pleasant object to see in his black crape mask.</p>

<p>Not a word passed between them, but she silently
wrapped Geraldine in the cloak and hood ready for her
journey.</p>

<p>The daring actor lifted the girl as though she had been
a little child, and taking the hand-bag also, stole from the
house undetected, and made his way to a sleigh that was
in waiting around the nearest corner.</p>

<p>Then Miss Erroll, shivering like one in an ague fit, proceeded
to finish her work.</p>

<p>She locked the door, and re-made the dainty bed, so that
it had the appearance of not having been slept in that
night.</p>

<p>Upon the pillow she pinned the note that she had written
in Geraldine's hand, and to which she had signed Geraldine's
name.</p>

<p>And, lastly, and just before leaving the room, she sank
on her knees, and prayed with dramatic fervor:</p>

<p>"Oh, God, if Thou wilt hear the prayer of a wretch like
me, I implore that Thou wilt watch over and protect from
harm the poor girl whom I have betrayed into that
wretch's hands!"</p>

<p>When the hue and cry arose the next morning over Geraldine's
disappearance, she was as much excited as any,
and her grief was as noisy as that of the others.</p>

<p>She was indeed grieved and remorseful over her evil
deed, and she had only one comfort to offer herself:</p>

<p>"Self-preservation is the first law of nature."</p>

<p>She had saved herself, and, as the days dragged by, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
first terror of discovery gave place to a conviction of
safety. Not the least suspicion had pointed her out as the
wretch she was. The children still remained devoted to
her, Mrs. Fitzgerald was kind, Miss Carroll courteous, the
servants respectful. She began to breathe freely again,
saying, to herself:</p>

<p>"Why should I fret? Of course Standish has married the
girl, and she ought to be glad to get such a handsome husband!"</p>

<p>She could not banish a little bitter jealousy of Geraldine,
for once she had hoped to marry Standish herself, and the
old passion still ached in her heart, though she had fled
from him in horror when she learned that he had a living
wife.</p>

<p>Now that two weeks had passed, she supposed they were
married and happy, and some day there might be a reconciliation
between the mother and daughter and the son-in-law
who had so cleverly stolen his bride. Standish had
promised that no matter what happened, his confederate's
agency in the affair should never be known.</p>

<p>But she would not have begun to feel so confident of her
position if she could have heard what the detective, Norris,
was saying that day to Hawthorne.</p>

<p>"That governess helped him, as sure as you're born, Mr.
Daly."</p>

<p>Hawthorne said, hurriedly:</p>

<p>"You may call me by another name henceforward&mdash;that
of Hawthorne. I confess that Daly was an assumed one.
And now, about this governess?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there's no time to lose, Mr. Hawthorne, in beating
about the bush. That poor girl has been missing for two
weeks, and God only knows what has come to her ere
now. We must see this Erroll woman at once, and surprise
her into confession by taxing her with the crime."</p>

<p>"A clever idea. Let us confront her at once," cried Hawthorne,
with burning impatience.</p>

<p>"I'm with you to the death!" laughed the jovial little
detective, springing to his feet, and within the hour they
arrived at the mansion, and sent their cards to Miss Errol.</p>

<p>They had chosen Cissy Carroll to bear them, and the
governess looked at her, pale with affright.</p>

<p>"I do not know these men, Hawthorne and Norris. I
cannot see them," she declared at first.</p>

<p>But Cissy was firm.</p>

<p>"You must go down. They said their business was important,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
and they would not leave without seeing you,"
she said.</p>

<p>"I dare not see them! I am afraid!" faltered the guilty
woman.</p>

<p>"Why should you be afraid? Have you done anything
wrong?" demanded Cissy, sternly, for a terrible suspicion
was troubling her mind.</p>

<p>The woman shot her a keen glance, and asked:</p>

<p>"Have you betrayed me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I will see them, but they must have made a mistake.
I am not the person they want."</p>

<p>Putting on an expression of bravado, she followed Cissy
to the presence of the two men, who both rose and bowed
profoundly, though they read the signs of guilt in her
ghastly face. Then the detective said:</p>

<p>"Miss Erroll, will you kindly favor us with the address
of your lover, Mr. Clifford Standish?"</p>

</div></div>


<p>When that startling question fell on Miss Erroll's ears
she gave a convulsive gasp, and sank limply into the nearest
chair.</p>

<p>The skilled detective saw quickly that the woman was a
coward at heart, and would not be able to sustain the air
of bravado with which she had entered.</p>

<p>Advancing quickly to her side, he threw back the lapel
of his overcoat, revealing to her frightened eyes his detective
badge, and continuing:</p>

<p>"I am in search of Clifford Standish, and you must tell
me where to find him."</p>

<p>She trembled like a leaf in a storm, and muttered, with
weak defiance:</p>

<p>"How should I know?"</p>

<p>Norris answered, boldly:</p>

<p>"Because you have been in secret correspondence with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the man for weeks. Because you were his confederate in
the kidnaping of Miss Geraldine Harding."</p>

<p>The cry of a beaten animal burst from the cowering woman's
lips, and her form shook with fear.</p>

<p>"You cannot deny it," added Norris, following up his
advantage, while Cissy and Hawthorne looked on in
breathless interest.</p>

<p>She lifted her pallid face and groaned:</p>

<p>"Who is my accuser?"</p>

<p>"I am, and this gentleman here, Miss Harding's betrothed,
the Harry Hawthorne whom it was pretended in
that forged note the young lady had eloped with. I have
been watching you and Standish for several weeks, Miss
Erroll, and had I not been called away by other business,
you had never succeeded in that nefarious abduction. But
I have facts enough to warrant me in threatening you with
arrest unless you make a full confession!"</p>

<p>"Arrest me?"</p>

<p>Almost hissing the words, she sprang to her feet, glaring
fiercely at him, but the flash of bravado did not intimidate
the fearless little detective.</p>

<p>"Yes, you," he answered, coolly. "But, after all, I do
not like to war upon a woman, even a bad one; so tell me
the truth now if you want to escape a prison-cell."</p>

<p>Quaking with fear, she dropped back into her chair, covering
her writhing features with her trembling white
hands.</p>

<p>After waiting a moment vainly for her to answer, he
asked:</p>

<p>"Where is Clifford Standish now?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"How long since you saw him?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks ago to-night."</p>

<p>"At the time of the kidnaping of Miss Harding?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Her answers were given as if dragged from her under
stress of fear, but it was plain that she meant to make the
confession he demanded.</p>

<p>He flashed Cissy and Hawthorne a triumphant look, then
said, briskly:</p>

<p>"Tell us all about that night and your share in it, as
quickly as you can, for our time is very precious."</p>

<p>So, with her head drooped in bitter shame, and eyes
downcast, lest she should meet their glances of scorn and
execration, the beautiful woman whose sins had followed
her so relentlessly, poured out the story of that night's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
wrong-doing, her heart sinking in despair the while, for
before her she saw the dark future opening like Hades, so
awful in its gloom.</p>

<p>And in all the bitterness of that moment the cruelest
thought of all was that Cissy was listening to her confession
of sin, and would hate and despise her now for her
ingratitude after all the kindness she had showered on her
worthless head.</p>

<p>Somehow, she had coveted Cissy's respect and good-will,
and to lose them was most bitter to her pride.</p>

<p>The cup of her humiliation was full, but she had to drink
it to the bitter dregs.</p>

<p>When she drew breath in silence at last, after telling of
the note she had pinned on the pillow, Harry Hawthorne
cried, indignantly:</p>

<p>"Why did you lend yourself to this terrible deed?"</p>

<p>Miss Erroll looked at Cissy and faltered:</p>

<p>"You can tell him why."</p>

<p>Cissy answered:</p>

<p>"I think he knew some dark secret in her past that she
was anxious to hide, now that she is leading a better life,
and he threatened her with betrayal unless she helped him
to carry out his plot. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"It is the truth. I tried to keep from doing it, but I
could not get out of his power. Oh, how hard it is for a
woman who has once done wrong to lead a good life again!
The avenging fates pursue her to death or madness!"
groaned the detected governess.</p>

<p>"But, now," cried Norris, impatiently, "now tell us
where that fiend was to take Miss Harding after he placed
her in the sleigh that you say he had waiting at the corner."</p>

<p>"He told me he had engaged an old woman to take charge
of her till she consented to marry him. He said she was a
terrible old woman, who lived alone on a farm about five
miles from the city, and kept a savage bull-dog on the
place."</p>

<p>"By Heaven! I know the place, and the woman!" almost
shouted the detective. Then, calming himself, he added:</p>

<p>"She is Jane Crabtree, an old woman as big as a giant,
who has been in the criminal courts twice, once for beating
almost to death a child she had taken from the poor-house
and secondly for the murder of her husband. He died of
arsenical poison, and the woman was accused of administering
it, but they could not prove it and she got off by
swearing he committed suicide. But I always felt sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
that she did the deed, for it was proved they led a cat-and-dog
life. Since this happened, three months ago, it is said
that she never permits any person on the premises, and
keeps a large bull-dog unchained all the time; so, if Miss
Harding is in the clutches of that old wretch, it is time
we were moving toward her delivery. Come," and he motioned
Hawthorne away.</p>

<p>In their haste to be gone they paid no more attention to
the governess, and with a hasty adieu to Cissy, left the
room.</p>

<p>The two women were left alone, and Miss Erroll crouched
wretchedly in her chair, not daring to look up and meet
Cissy's glance of scorn.</p>

<p>She started when the girl's voice fell on her ear&mdash;clear,
cold, disdainful.</p>

<p>"What shall you do now?"</p>

<p>The woman lifted her face, deadly pale, but grown suddenly
calm with a great despair.</p>

<p>"I must go away&mdash;at once!" she answered.</p>

<p>Then she fell at Cissy's feet.</p>

<p>"You, who have been so good already&mdash;grant my last
prayer," she faltered.</p>

<p>Cissy looked down in silent inquiry at the haggard face.</p>

<p>"Do not tell Mrs. Fitzgerald of this story until I am gone
out of her house forever. I love her and the darling children;
they have been good to me, and I could not bear
their reproaches. I will go now and pack my trunk, and
send for it later. Let me steal out of the house, like the
wretched outcast I am, before you tell them my miserable
story."</p>

<p>"Your wish is granted," answered Cissy, huskily.</p>

<p>She went away then to her own room and sat a while in
earnest thought.</p>

<p>Then she went to Miss Erroll's door and tapped softly.</p>

<p>It was opened by the governess, who had made such
speed that her hat and cloak were already on and her
trunk strapped.</p>

<p>"You are going now?" asked Cissy.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"To seek some humble lodging-house, and begin again
the horrible struggle of a lonely woman for an honest living,"
the poor wretch answered, bitterly.</p>

<p>"Have you any money?"</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars that I have saved in the few months that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
I have been here&mdash;enough to starve on perhaps until I find
another situation."</p>

<p>"Take this to help you," Cissy said, pressing a hundred-dollar
bill into her hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Carroll, I cannot. You, too, are poor. It may
be your little all."</p>

<p>"No, I have more. In fact, I received two hundred dollars
yesterday from a lawyer in New York, who has been
managing some lawsuits for me against a villain who
brought a false claim against my grandfather's estate, and
thus threw me penniless on the world. My lawyer has won
the suit, and I shall have several thousand dollars of my
own very soon."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Miss Carroll. You deserve all the
good fortune that can fall to a noble woman. Heaven forever
bless you. I accept your gift gratefully, because&mdash;because
it&mdash;may save me, poor tempted wretch, from a life
of sin."</p>

<p>"That was why I gave it to you. I hoped it might keep
you in the right path."</p>

<p>"It shall! It shall! Oh, Miss Carroll, I am a repentant
sinner, and since I am spared this time, I will never be
tempted to do wrong again! I swear&mdash;I swear to you, in
return for your angelic goodness&mdash;that I will repent my
sins, seek God's forgiveness, try to lead a good life, and
meet you&mdash;angel that you are&mdash;in heaven!"</p>

<p>She snatched Cissy's hand, pressed her burning lips
upon it, and rushed from the house out into the blinding
snow storm that darkened the air.</p>

<p>Then Cissy went to Mrs. Fitzgerald to tell her of all that
had transpired, and to help her to bear the terrible suspense
over Geraldine's fate.</p>

<span class="i3">All vanished, all gone, like a dream!"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>We must follow the fortunes of Geraldine after being
placed in the sleigh by her cowardly abductor.</p>

<p>Tucking the sleeping girl warmly under the heavy
robes, he took the reins from the man he had employed to
hold them, and drove off at a spanking pace for his destination,
the old country-house of which Miss Erroll had told
the detective.</p>

<p>As the night was propitious to his purpose, and the road
remarkably fine, he reached the place in a short while, and
without any misadventure.</p>

<p>The old woman, Jane Crabtree, in expectation of his
coming, had muzzled the savage bull-dog, and came down
the lane to the gate to meet him, as they had agreed upon.</p>

<p>The woman was a giant in stature, as the detective had
said, and looked strong enough to floor John L. Sullivan
with one hand.</p>

<p>In the light of the bull's-eye lantern that Standish flared
into her eyes, her coarse face, with its straggling black
locks blown about by the swirling snow, looked capable of
committing any evil deed.</p>

<p>He dropped some twenty-dollar gold pieces into her
hand, gave her some instructions, and drove his team
toward the city. A few hours later he boarded a train for
Cincinnati at daylight, and remained away five days, in
order to throw the searchers for Geraldine off guard.</p>

<p>But as we have seen, the forged note, representing that
she had gone of her own free will to marry her betrothed,
had effectually prevented any hue and cry over Geraldine's
disappearance.</p>

<p>So the villainous abductor had it all his own way, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
for two long weeks, until Hawthorne's return, he was free
to come and go as he chose in the prosecution of his designs
against the poor girl.</p>

<p>As for the poor victim, who can judge of her surprise
and terror on awaking the next morning from her drugged
sleep, in a strange room, and guarded by an old giant of a
woman, with the most villainous face she had ever beheld.</p>

<p>The night before she had fallen asleep in her own lovely,
luxurious room, and the last sight her eyes had rested on
was the handsome, smiling face of Miss Erroll, the governess.</p>

<p>But her sleep had been haunted by terrible nightmare
dreams, and when she waked at last in that shabby room
in the presence of her horrible old jailer, she thought that
she was dreaming still.</p>

<p>Recoiling from the woman, she threw out her arms,
groaning helplessly:</p>

<p>"Oh, those dreadful nightmare dreams! How they haunt
me! Will not some one wake me, please? Martha, where
are you? Come to me at once. Oh, Cissy! oh, mamma!"</p>

<p>Old Jane Crabtree came and stood over her scowlingly,
snapping out:</p>

<p>"You an't dreamin', gal; you is wide awake!"</p>

<p>But it took her some little time to assure her captive
that this was not a continuation of her terrible nightmare
dreams.</p>

<p>When she at last convinced her that this was an awful
reality, and boldly told her that Clifford Standish had
brought her here in a drugged sleep, the terrible truth
rushed over her mind.</p>

<p>"That wine Miss Erroll gave me was drugged! She was
in the plot!" she cried, wildly.</p>

<p>The hag nodded sullenly, and Geraldine continued, passionately:</p>

<p>"He will never get my consent to marry him, never!"</p>

<p>And then she fell to pleading with the old woman for
her liberty, promising to make her rich if she would only
restore her to her friends.</p>

<p>But Jane Crabtree laughed her to scorn, sneering at the
idea of Geraldine being able to reward her for her liberty.</p>

<p>Standish had cleverly prepared her for all that the girl
might threaten or promise, by telling her not to listen to
anything, as the girl was only a poor salesgirl from Siegel
&amp; Cooper's, on a salary of three dollars a week.</p>

<p>So the old witch grunted scornfully at her pleadings,
threats, and promises, and presently went out, locking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
door after her until she returned with a coarse breakfast of
badly served food, from which the girl turned with loathing.</p>

<p>While she was absent, Geraldine rose and looked from
the window to see if there was any chance of escape.</p>

<p>What she saw made her turn shudderingly back to the
bright coal-fire, the only cheerful object in the poor room.</p>

<p>The window was very small, and the grimy panes were
guarded by heavy iron bars.</p>

<p>Beyond these bars Geraldine saw a level stretch of country
covered with a mantle of snow. A wild snow-storm
was raging, and the wind drove against the shutters with
terrible violence, banging them to and fro until the old
house shook in the terrible gale.</p>

<p>She realized that she was in a farm-house, far removed
from any other habitation, and that if she could have
walked out of the house at that moment she must have
perished in the deep drifts of snow while struggling to escape.</p>

<p>That terrible first day passed in alternate weeping and
praying. Standish did not make his appearance, and Jane
Crabtree remained down stairs, attending to her household
tasks, except when she came up to replenish the fire and
minister to the wants of her captive.</p>

<p>That first day Geraldine ate nothing. At night she
sobbed herself to sleep.</p>

<p>The next day hunger drove her to partake of a little of
the coarse food.</p>

<p>For three days the monotonous blizzard raged, and the
snow grew deeper and deeper. Geraldine felt as if she
should go mad.</p>

<p>She wondered despairingly if she should ever get free
from the power of her cruel jailer, or if she should die
here, as old Jane had boldly threatened.</p>

<p>The woman had become very impatient over Geraldine's
continued weeping, and one day she said, roughly:</p>

<p>"You might as well hush that snivelin' an' make your
mind up ter marry that man, for if you don't he'll kill
you!"</p>

<p>"Kill me! He dare not!"</p>

<p>"He'll dare anything, and if he don't, I will. Sho! I
don't mind killin' anybody. I beat a poor-house chile to
death last year, and only three months ago I p'isened my
husband with arsenic. An' that isn't all I done, neither,
for&mdash;&mdash;" She paused in the recital of her crimes, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
listener had dropped limply in a swoon, overcome by the
horror of the story.</p>

<p>Oh, the weary days, and the terror-haunted nights! How
did the poor captive drag through them? The wonder to
her ever afterward was that she did not go mad.</p>

<p>At last Clifford Standish came.</p>

<p>It was a full week since he had brought her there and
the storm had somewhat abated in violence, but the snow
still lay deep upon the ground, and the wailing of the
winter wind was like the knell of hope in her ears.</p>

<p>The door opened, and her cowardly abductor stood within
the room, gazing at his cruel work.</p>

<p>Pretty Geraldine had wept till her brown eyes were dim
and heavy, with purple shadows beneath them, and her
cheeks all wan and sunken. She had not taken the trouble
to exchange her blanket wrapper for the cloth gown Miss
Erroll had put in the hand-bag. She had not given a
thought to her appearance.</p>

<p>But even her disheveled locks and haggard looks could
not quench the fire of passion in the villain's heart. He
looked at her gloatingly, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Good-morning, pretty Geraldine. I suppose that after
your week with Jane Crabtree, you are glad to see even
me!"</p>

<p>Geraldine gave the smooth villain a glance of measureless
contempt as she answered, bitterly:</p>

<p>"The sight of his satanic majesty would be more welcome
than you, Clifford Standish!"</p>

<p>"Still defiant!" he laughed, mockingly. "Why, I
thought that a week of Mrs. Crabtree's society would bring
you to your senses!"</p>

<p>"Say rather would cause me to lose my senses!" she retorted,
bitterly, and there was a moment's silence, which
he broke by saying, impatiently:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will come to the purpose of my visit, Geraldine, I
wish to marry you."</p>

<p>"So you have told me before," disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Well, I tell you so again, and I am fully determined
that you shall become my wife!"</p>

<p>"You have a wife already, you villain!"</p>

<p>"She died in New York recently, and I am free to offer
you my hand in honorable marriage. Will you accept it,
Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"Never! I would die before I would marry you!"</p>

<p>"It is the alternative you must accept unless you become
my bride!"</p>

<p>The steel-blue glitter of his eyes was diabolical as he
fixed them upon her, and continued:</p>

<p>"Of course you understand that I have run a great risk
in bringing you here, and made myself liable to the law
for kidnaping&mdash;that is, unless you marry me, and give the
affair the color of an elopement."</p>

<p>He paused, but she did not speak, so he went on:</p>

<p>"No search is being made for you by your friends, for a
note was left in your room, stating that you had fled to
marry your lover, Harry Hawthorne. Your mother believes
that statement, and so there is not the least suspicion
that I carried you off."</p>

<p>"You fiend!" she cried; then added: "But Harry Hawthorne
will search for me!"</p>

<p>"Harry Hawthorne gave up the search for you weeks
ago, and sailed for Europe."</p>

<p>"It is false!"</p>

<p>"It is perfectly true. Why he went, I know not, but I
have read in a New York paper of his going. Believe me
or not, as you will, my charmer, but you are entirely in
my power, without hope of rescue, and I am desperate
with love for you. I will not permit rivalry from any living
man. Either my bride you shall be, or the bride of
Death!"</p>

<p>She sat listening and shuddering before the terrible decision
of his words, and the blue fire of his determined
eyes. She felt that neither prayers nor tears would move
him. He was mad with love, stubborn with a sense of
power.</p>

<p>Changing his mood, he began to pour out in burning
words all the mighty strength of his passion, pleading,
raving, imploring her kindness in return.</p>

<p>He might as well have prayed to a statue, so changeless
was the scorn of her silent lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>He asked her, almost frantically:</p>

<p>"Do you understand that unless you marry me there is
no appeal from the sentence of death?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand; but I consider death preferable to a
union with you."</p>

<p>Angered by the scorn of her words, he retorted:</p>

<p>"It will be a cruel death, I warn you, at the hands of
old Jane Crabtree and your body will not even have
Christian burial. It will be flung into an old disused well
on the premises, and the secret of your fate will never be
known."</p>

<p>"Be it so. At least, you cannot murder my soul. It will
return to the God who gave it," she replied, dauntlessly
bravely, determined that he should not have the satisfaction
of seeing her wince before his threats.</p>

<p>He rose, with a baffled air, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"I shall not consider this answer final. I shall give you
one more week in which to decide your fate."</p>

<p>Geraldine's heart leaped with joy. Another week's respite!
And who could tell what might happen in that time?
She had been praying, praying, praying all the while.
Perhaps God would save her from her enemy's wiles.</p>

<p>Smiling grimly, Clifford Standish continued:</p>

<p>"I shall leave old Jane to plead my cause with you, and
I believe that she will prove a powerful advocate. So sure
am I of her ultimate success, that in a week I shall return,
bringing with me a justice of the peace, empowered with
authority to join us in matrimonial bonds. If you refuse,
I shall go away, leaving you in the hands of old Jane, to
be tortured to death and buried in the old well!"</p>

<p>Not a word came from the white lips of the girl, but the
scorn of her eyes was fiery enough to make him hurry
from her presence with a stifled oath.</p>

<p>She saw him leave with a great strangling sob of relief,
and murmured:</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, he will not come again for a week.
Something will surely happen in all that time."</p>

<p>But she did not know yet all the horrors that week held
in store for her, or why Clifford Standish had smiled so
grimly, when he spoke of old Jane's advocacy of his suit.</p>

<p>They had planned a desperate expedient.</p>

<p>Each day the cruel woman presented herself with the
harsh question:</p>

<p>"Will you marry Clifford Standish?"</p>

<p>Geraldine always answered "Never!" and each time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
old woman flew at her in a fury, and administered a severe
beating.</p>

<p>"He told me to do it," she would exclaim, angrily.</p>

<p>The prints of her cruel hands would be left on Geraldine's
tender face in crimson streaks; her arms and shoulders
bore purple bruises on their whiteness, but though
each day brought a more severe chastisement than the
last, Geraldine's answer was still the same:</p>

<p>"Never! Never!"</p>

<p>Her daily portions of food grew less in quantity, and
more inferior in quality, so that only the severest pangs
of hunger forced her to swallow the coarse mess. But for
the hope of rescue, she would have left it untouched, and
starved herself.</p>

<p>The old fiend began also to neglect the fire, so that the
freezing winter winds, as they swept across the snow-covered
prairie land, penetrated the cracks of the old frame
house and chilled poor Geraldine until her fair face looked
blue and pinched from the cold.</p>

<p>"I shall beat, and starve, and freeze you into consent!"
snarled wicked old Jane, in a rage at the girl's stubbornness.</p>

<p>"You may kill my body, but you cannot bend my will!"
answered the resolute victim.</p>

<p>But from weakness of the body her hopefulness began
to fail. She cried out that God had forgotten her; she
ceased to pray for rescue; she asked only that death would
come quickly.</p>

<p>But the slow days and nights dragged on till the week
was at an end, and still the strength of youth kept life in
her sore and aching frame.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon old Jane came up stairs.</p>

<p>"He is coming. I see the sleigh off in the distance now.
He will bring the justice to marry you to him!" she
snarled.</p>

<p>Geraldine did not answer; she had already been beaten
and kicked that day so that she was barely able to rise
from the chair where she was crouching.</p>

<p>The woman continued, threateningly:</p>

<p>"If you do not marry him, he will leave you here for me
to kill. Do you know how I shall do it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I shall turn the dog on you. He has been kept without
food two days, to make him savage. He would tear a
stranger to pieces. He has never seen you, so when I 'sic'
him on you, he will spring at your throat and make mincemeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
of you. While you are still warm and bleeding, I
shall throw your body into the old well!"</p>

<p>It was horrible to listen to her, but Geraldine only
trembled and hid her face. Two weeks of misery had inured
her to such brutality.</p>

<p>"I must go now and chain up Towser, so they can get
in," added the old wretch, going down, after locking the
door as usual, to receive her guests.</p>

<p>They came in, Standish and the justice of the peace he
had bribed to accompany him&mdash;a villain, if ever a man's
face spoke truly, who would stop at nothing if tempted by
gold.</p>

<p>The actor whispered to Jane Crabtree, nervously:</p>

<p>"Has she consented?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;although I've half-killed her tryin' to break her
will."</p>

<p>Curses, low and deep, breathed over his lips; then he
said:</p>

<p>"Well, we won't go up stairs to see her yet. We're half-frozen
with this beastly cold, anyway, so we'll thaw out
over the fire and a bottle of wine."</p>

<p>They drew up their chairs to the glowing kitchen fire,
smoked, drank, and even played a game of cards, for now
that the final moment had arrived, the villain's nerve began
to fail him, and he began to realize his crime in all its
enormity.</p>

<p>And while he lingered there, dreading the consummation
of the crowning act of his villainy, along the road he had
traveled another sleigh was speeding toward the farm&mdash;a
double sleigh&mdash;and in it were seated Harry Hawthorne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
Detective Norris, and two stalwart policemen detailed on
special duty for this occasion.</p>

<p>Fast flew the gallant horses under the gently urging
hand of the driver, until they were in sight, then Norris
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There's the old house now. And, see!&mdash;a sleigh at the
gate! Perhaps Standish is there now, the villain! We will
be extremely lucky if we catch him on the spot!"</p>

<p>At the same moment, Standish tossed off a bumper of
wine, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Here's to the bride, the beautiful heiress! Come, let's
get the ceremony over!"</p>

<p>The three conspirators filed up stairs and into the room
where Geraldine, more dead than alive, crouched in her
chair in terror of their coming.</p>

<p>Standish, whose spirits were much elated by generous
potations of wine, crossed over to her, crying, gayly:</p>

<p>"Give us a kiss, pretty one! I've come to marry you at
last! Here's the preacher&mdash;justice, I mean. He can tie the
knot just as well. Hello, Jane! if you're the bridesmaid,
get her up on her feet by my side, will you?"</p>

<p>The justice planted himself in readiness to perform the
ceremony, but Geraldine would not permit any one to
drag her up from her seat.</p>

<p>She fought off their hands with a wonderful strength,
born of desperation, and shriek after shriek, loud, agonized,
ear-piercing, burst from her pale lips.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the sound of those defiant shrieks that
drowned the sound of bells as the second sleigh dashed up
to the gate, and the men tumbled out pell-mell into the
lane.</p>

<p>But the winter wind bore to their ears the sound of Geraldine's
awful cries, and their feet seemed winged, as,
headed by Hawthorne, they rushed up the lane and threw
themselves altogether against the locked door.</p>

<p>It yielded and fell in with their united weight, tumbling
all together upon the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>But each sprang to his feet and followed the sound of
those frantic shrieks up a rickety stair-way to another
locked door.</p>

<p>"Now all together again, lads&mdash;push!" shouted Hawthorne,
and under the strong onslaught the second door
yielded, the lock fell off, and they were on the scene of action.</p>

<p>And, oh, what a scene!</p>

<p>Clifford Standish and the old woman had dragged Geraldine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
from her chair, despite her desperate shrieks and
struggles, and were holding her up between them, while
the half-drunken justice mumbled over the words of the
marriage service.</p>

<p>The conspirators, thus taken by surprise, dropped their
victim and turned to fly, but the clubs of the agile policemen
quickly strewed the floor with three groaning
wretches.</p>

<p>As for Hawthorne, he thought only of Geraldine. She
flew to him, and he clasped her in his arms, crying:</p>

<p>"Oh, my love, my love! I have come to save you!"</p>

<p>It was a tender meeting, but its pathos was quite lost on
Norris and the policemen, who were busy putting handcuffs
on the three prisoners, whose dose of clubs had reduced
them to a dazed condition that made them easy to
conquer.</p>

<p>The surprise had been a complete one, and extremely
successful&mdash;so much so that all three of the conspirators
were taken away as prisoners by the jubilant Norris and
the two policemen.</p>

<p>And, to dispose of the subject at once, we may add that
all three were committed to jail, had a speedy trial, and
were convicted of kidnaping and conspiracy. An indignant
judge and jury awarded them the severest sentence
under the law, and they were sent to prison for a long
term of years during which their energies were expended
in labor for the State of Illinois.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It would be too great a task to describe the joy of the
Fitzgerald household that evening when Harry Hawthorne
restored Geraldine to her home, or their grief and indignation
when they learned the terrible persecutions she
had suffered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald's gratitude to Harry Hawthorne was
boundless.</p>

<p>She scarcely remembered the existence of the English
nobleman, whose title she had so ardently desired for Geraldine.</p>

<p>She realized how true was Hawthorne's affection when
she saw him weep the bitterest tears over the cruel bruises
that for several days empurpled the poor girl's face and
hands&mdash;marks of the brutal blows she had been given by
Jane Crabtree while trying to force her consent to marry
Clifford Standish.</p>

<p>"He loves her with the devotion of a noble heart, and I
will not stand between them, even though he is only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
poor fireman. Besides, he really saved her life from those
murderous wretches, and it belongs to him," she thought,
generously.</p>

<p>So, when he came to her a few days later, asking her for
the second time for her approval of his suit for Geraldine's
hand, she accepted him with pleasure for her son-in-law.</p>

<p>And then she said, with a smile:</p>

<p>"But I hope you will not carry my dear girl away from
me when you are married. This house is large enough for
us all."</p>

<p>Thinking that he was poor, she wished to make the future
as easy for him as possible.</p>

<p>But Hawthorne answered:</p>

<p>"I thank you for your generosity, but I have a home in
England, and a widowed mother awaiting me."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," she said, wonderingly.</p>

<p>Just then Geraldine and Cissy came in, with the two
children, who were enjoying the freedom of having no
governess at present.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald called Geraldine to her side, kissed her
beautiful brow, and said:</p>

<p>"I have just given you away, my darling, to your
worthy lover."</p>

<p>Geraldine blushed deeply, as Hawthorne drew her to his
side and said:</p>

<p>"Dearest, I have just been telling your dear mother that
our home must be in England when we are married. Indeed,
I have a letter of introduction from my own mother
to yours, which I must now deliver."</p>

<p>He bowed gracefully to Mrs. Fitzgerald, who opened the
letter with a mystified air.</p>

<p>Directly she looked up, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"But this is very puzzling. The letter is from my English
cousin, Lady Putnam, to introduce her son, Lord Leland
Harry Putnam."</p>

<p>"I am he, Mrs. Fitzgerald," the young man said, with
another low bow, but it took many minutes of explanation
to convince her of the truth, and then she said, beamingly:</p>

<p>"But why did you deceive us?"</p>

<p>"Can you not guess? I wished to test Geraldine's love,
and to win your regard as simple Harry Hawthorne, the
poor fireman. I have succeeded, and now I am perfectly
happy."</p>

<p>So were they all, if their radiant faces were an index of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
their feelings, and Lord Putnam made Geraldine blush
very brightly when he added:</p>

<p>"My mother and sister told me to tell you that they will
come to America to our wedding, and they hope it will be
soon, as Amy especially is anxious to see this country."</p>

<p>When he brought Ralph Washburn and Leroy Hill to
call the next day, they sounded the praises of beautiful
Lady Amy so persistently that Geraldine was in love with
her new sister before she ever saw her, and she wondered
which one of the handsome young lovers would win the
charming beauty.</p>

<p>She persuaded Cissy to be married on the same day as
herself and Cameron Clemens, although very impatient
for the marriage, consented to the postponement to please
the two fair brides.</p>

<p>"Won't it be just too lovely to be married on the same
day, Cissy, and cross the ocean together on our bridal tour
and spend our honeymoons at Castle Raneleigh? We must
write and tell the Stansburys and Odells, and send them
invitations," cried pretty Geraldine, who was so happy in
her love that she wanted all her old friends to rejoice with
her when she was wedded to her heart's dear choice.</p>

<p>The happy day is set for June, dear reader, and I am
invited to the double wedding.</p>

<h3><span class="u">CONSULT THE CRITICS.</span></h3>

<p class="center">The NEW YORK SUN says:</p>

<p>"Frederick R. Burton has supplied us with a cleverly constructed and interesting story
in 'The Mission of Poubalov.' ... In regard to Mr. Burton's Russian police agent,
we hasten to say that he has commended himself to us as both reasonable and interesting.
As we remember, he does not once put himself to the conventional trouble of assuming a
disguise, and yet he gets on remarkably well. Just as curiously, his business in New York
is not to administer the vengeance of the Czar, but to do a kindly and charitable deed.
The ordinary reader will be at no pains to discover and appreciate certain plain points
about this story. It is a story with a plot, and the narrative is conscientiously and cleverly
accomplished. Mr. Burton understands perfectly that very valuable principle of the storyteller's
art whereby the curiosity of the reader is quickly aroused, duly maintained, and
finally gratified. His police agent is a vigorous figure, and his heroine enjoys the distinction
of being able to face some other aspect than that of lachrymose despair. She is an
excellent heroine, a good talker and a sensible, clever person, and we cordially congratulate
Mr. Burton upon her presence in his book. So we do congratulate him upon a generally
capable and interesting story."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">From THE BOSTON HERALD.</p>

<p>"The style of the story is not unlike that
of the 'Mr. Barnes of New York' series, and
the handling of mystery very nearly approaches
Anna Katharine Green's dexterity.</p>

<p>Ingenious in plot, exciting in incident,
and sensational enough even for warm
summer afternoons, the volume teems with
interest. The characters stand boldly forward
in a drama that moves breathlessly
along without a break to mar its smoothness,
or to interrupt the clews relating to
the sudden disappearance of a lover upon
his wedding day, within an hour of the
ceremony. Aside from this, the story is a
singular instance of the constancy and faith
of a woman who is worth loving. She
spends her energy in trying to discover her
lover, not in tears over his apparent desertion.
Real power in a detective story is
shown in keeping the mystery veiled until
the end, and this Mr. Burton has done."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">From THE CHICAGO DAILY NEWS.</p>

<p>"His story is of the sensational style&mdash;sensational
in a clean and wholesome way&mdash;and
proves the author has surmounted the
first difficulties which usually attack the
man who attempts to write a 'detective
story.' There are no hitches or flagging
of interest in spots, the plot is coherent and
sufficiently intricate to cause a reader to sit
up late to finish the tale, and the finale&mdash;that
bunker at which ignominiously tumble
most sensational writers&mdash;is logical and not
to be quarreled with. Nothing puts a
reader in such bad humor with his author
as to be let down flat after an exciting chase.
Mr. Burton sends one off on a sky rocket,
perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p>Poubalov, who in the title arouses recollections
of Gilbert Parker's or Mary Hartwell
Catherwood's field of work, is that
melodramatic character, a polished, impregnable,
invincible, all-powerful, diabolical,
Russian secret-service official.... Mr.
Burton, if he improves, will rank with the
best writers of exciting tales."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">From THE YONKERS STATESMAN.</p>

<p>"One of the most readable and entertaining
novels that we have read in some time
is 'The Mission of Poubalov,' by Frederick
R. Burton.... Mr. Burton seems rapidly
to be making a name for himself in the
literary world as a story-writer of much
more than the average ability, and in this
book he has constructed a plot which so
fascinates the reader that one is loath to
drop the volume until he has reached the
page that bears 'The End;' then comes the
feeling of satisfaction that he has read a
good story, well told, abounding in interest,
full of life and action, and having not a few
startling surprises."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">From THE ST. LOUIS STAR.</p>

<p>"This is a story of intricate plot and
incessant action. It is safe to say that one
who reads the first chapter will read the
second, and from that to the third, and so to
the end of the book will be a progression on
the part of the reader that cannot well be
avoided. The interest never flags. Poubalov
himself is a powerful and fascinating
character study; Miss Hillman is hardly
less so, though necessarily the American
girl is not so picturesque as the Russian
spy; and the tragic force with which the
weakness of the unhappy little tailor, Litizki,
is set forth, adds immensely to the grip this
story takes upon the reader's sympathies."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">From THE SOMERVILLE CITIZEN, Somerville, Mass.</p>

<p>"Sensational reading is not always smooth reading and graceful writing is seldom sensational;
but when a story is not only sensational, but strong in treatment and at the same
time graceful in style, the reader derives rare pleasure from it and the author scores an
unusual success. 'The Mission of Poubalov' is by Frederick R. Burton. It appeals particularly
to the Bostonian, as the account is laid in that city. It is the superior of any
popular novel treating of Boston society we have yet seen. It is a detective story without
a detective, a love story without sentiment, yet teeming with subtlety and romance. The
great majority of readers will try to finish the book at a sitting."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">From THE BOSTON DAILY GLOBE.</p>

<p>"Next to an east wind when the mercury is dallying with the main truck, the most
refreshing thing is a well-written, cunningly constructed fiction, a tale that makes friends
with whoever picks it up. Such stories, to be sure, are rare, but once in a while, as with
incoming waves, one will appear that looms high above its flat-chested mates, and, like
the high roller, there is generally something to it. In 'The Mission of Poubalov,' Mr.
Frederick R. Burton, who, while engaged in newspaper work, had an opportunity to
study in real life characters necessary for the building up of an engaging fiction, has written
a capital story of love, intrigue and adventure that grips the attention like a vise. It is an
American story with a Russian flavor. The scene is Boston, and Mr. Burton plays his
characters around the West and South ends of the city with the skill of a master at chess.
The central figure, a Russian political exile, is introduced in his West end lodgings in
preparation for his wedding, and very early in the book all the characters are moving
briskly. An agent of the czar, who is by no means as bad as his countrymen have sketched
him, plays a most intricate and interesting role. His real motive is deftly concealed from
the reader until the lost bridegroom, who disappears in the first chapter, is found. Mr.
Burton's heroine is a brave, determined, never-say-die young woman whose faith in her
lover could not be shaken. She plays the part of detective in her own way which,
coupled with the efforts of the apparent villain who was really trying to help her, heightens
the interest of this very excellent story."</p>

the drama, with the same unique characters,
the same graphic scenes, but with
the narrative more artistically rounded

<h3>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS;</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Neil Burgess has rewritten his play, "The County Fair," in story-form. It
rounds out a narrative which is comparatively but sketched in the play. It only needs
the first sentence to set going the memory and imagination of those who have seen the
latter, and whet the appetite for the rest of this lively conception of a live dramatist.&mdash;<i>Brooklyn
Daily Eagle</i>.</p>

<p>As "The County Fair" threatens to remain in New York for a long time, the general
public out of town may be glad to learn that the playwright has put the piece into print
to the form of a story. A tale based upon a play may sometimes lack certain literary
qualities, but it never is the sort of thing over which any one can fall asleep. Fortunately,
"The County Fair" on the stage and in print is by the same author, so there
can be no reason for fearing that the book misses any of the points of the drama which
has been so successful.&mdash;<i>N. Y. Herald</i>.</p>

<p>The idea of turning successful plays into novels seems to be getting popular. The
latest book of this description is a story reproducing the action and incidents of Neil
Burgess' play, "The County Fair." The tale, which is a romance based on scenes of
home life and domestic joys and sorrows, follows closely the lines of the drama in
story and plot.&mdash;<i>Chicago Daily News</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Burgess' amusing play, "The County Fair," has been received with such favor
that he has worked it over and expanded it into a novel of more than 200 pages. It
will be enjoyed even by those who have never seen the play and still more by those
who have.&mdash;<i>Cincinnati Times-Star</i>.</p>

<p>This touching story effectively demonstrates that it is possible to produce a novel
which is at once wholesome and interesting in every part, without the introduction of
an impure thought or suggestion.&mdash;<i>Albany Press</i>.</p>

<p>Street &amp; Smith have issued "The County Fair." This is a faithful reproduction of
the drama of that name, and is an affecting and vivid story of domestic life, joy, and
sorrow, and rural scenes.&mdash;<i>San Francisco Call</i>.</p>

<p>This romance is written from the play of this name, and is full of touching incidents.&mdash;<i>Evansville
Journal</i>.</p>

<p>It is founded on the popular play of the same name, in which Neil Burgess, who is
also the author of the story, has achieved the dramatic success of the season.&mdash;<i>Fall
River Herald</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>What novels of Sir Walter Scott are to Britons, the romances of
Dumas to the French, such are the stories of the Flag Series to
Americans. Who among us does not revere our noble flag and the sainted
memory of the men who fought and fell in its sacred folds? And these
men were as ourselves; albeit cast upon days of more heroic mould.
They had virtues, vices, foibles and traits that endear, even as we of to-day.
They had wives and sweethearts who prayed for them in the battle hour,
and who listened to their serenades in the brief-snatched intervals of
wooing. Their lives are our history, and it is as necessary to know the
history of one's country as the catechism of one's faith. The stories of
the Flag Series are part and parcel of this history.</p>

Done into English.</i></p>

<p class="center">SOME PRESS COMMENTS.</p>

<p>"'Belle-Rose' is the tinted title of a 'Romance of the Cloak and Sword.'
It is brisk in style, crisp in dialogue, and intensely colorful. * * * 'Belle-Rose'
will be belle-read if a good, quick story has any charms for the fair."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Call</i>.</p>

<p>"Emile Faguet speaks of the 'Belle-Rose' of Amédée Achard as superior
to 'Le Capitaine Fracasse,' by Théophile Gautier. The purest love of woman,
the fidelity of man, the sacredness of friendship, intrigues of the court,
jealousies and revenge, a delightful touch of humor or pathos coming to the
relief at some tragic climax, give to the story a fascination for the reader."&mdash;<i>Brooklyn
Eagle</i>.</p>

<p>"The charm that is always to be found in the works of the best French
writers&mdash;quick, terse description, bright dialogue, rapidly shifting scenes
and incidents, leading up to intense climaxes&mdash;is well sustained in the story
of 'Belle-Rose.'"&mdash;<i>Boston Times</i>.</p>

<p>"'Belle-Rose' is a romance of love and war in the middle of the 17th
Century. It is true to the life of those troublous times, when the soldier
was such from youth to old age, resting only between battles to make love.
The translation is very good, indeed."&mdash;<i>Post-Intelligencer</i>.</p>

<p>"The story is full of love and passion, jealousy and revenge, the buffets
and rewards of war, with flashes of humor, and just those touches of nature
that make the whole world kin."&mdash;<i>Nashville American</i>.</p>

<p>Among the works of fiction there are few which partake of the character
of an historical romance, and when one is found that does it is appreciated.
Such an one is 'Belle-Rose,' by Amédée Achard. The author has
the knack of giving the details of a scene, or describing a character in so
few words that they might be likened unto pen sketches, and he carries the
reader along with something of the impetuous dash and fiery ardor that his
hero is so full of. The translation is very good."&mdash;<i>St. Louis Star</i>.</p>

<p>"Amédée Achard's romance of old France, 'Belle-Rose,' is a story of
incessant movement, warfare, intrigue, and all the elements which go to
the composition of an ingenious tale of love and adventure. The translation
is admirable."&mdash;<i>Buffalo Courier</i>.</p>

<p>"This story, the scenes of which are laid near Paris during the latter
part of the 17th Century, is one of those romances about the life of a soldier
during that bloody age, which seems to prove a great attraction to all
classes of readers. Fierce fighting, hair-breadth escapes, court intrigues,
are all blended with love-making, rescuing beauty in distress, and description
of the customs of the people in that age."&mdash;<i>Baltimore American</i>.</p>

<p>"'Belle-Rose' is a brilliant story, by Amédée Achard, one of the most
effective of French romance writers. It is a story of love and war, introducing
famous historical characters of the period, and will be read with
deep interest."&mdash;<i>Minneapolis Journal</i>.</p>

<p>This superb new edition of Mrs. Alex. McVeigh Miller's
famous stories consists of the choicest this much admired
authoress has written. Her works show a remarkable
versatility, treating in turn of life in the highest circles of
society and of the "simple annals of the poor." No lover
of wholesome and entertaining fiction can afford to leave
them unread.</p>

<h2><a name="BERTHA_M_CLAY" id="BERTHA_M_CLAY">BERTHA M. CLAY.</a></h2>


<p>The successor to this world-famous novelist has not yet appeared;
and from the present outlook it will be long ere a worthy rival of
the author of Dora Thorne will be discovered on the literary horizon.
Her pen-pictures of the cream of the British nobility have never been
equalled; her ability to weave a plot, full of tenderness, mystery and
passion, remains unrivalled. It is a positive relief to recur to these old
friends&mdash;healthy, warm-hearted women, handsome, aristocratic men, who
lived, loved and won or lost, according to their fate, after the deluge of
nauseabond, neurotic modern fiction that has been inundating our reading
tables for the past two or three years.</p>

<p>Cannot complain of it because it may be picked up at
any odd interval. It is easy to handle and there is
something fetching on every page, including the covers.</p>


<p class="sidenote"><b>HUMOR</b></p>

<p>The jokes and funny sketches of the YELLOW BOOK
are not libels on their name. Only the best and freshest
material is used. The man or woman who dislikes humor should see a
physician. But first try the YELLOW BOOK and save his fee if possible.</p>


<p class="sidenote"><b>PICTURES</b></p>

<p>The pictorial side of the YELLOW BOOK has never been
surpassed in any magazine of the price. The comic and
society drawings are by the same hands as furnish the more expensive
papers. The half-tone reproductions of current plays with full page
portraits of the principal players, are worthy a place in your
scrap-book.</p>


<p class="sidenote"><b>VERSES</b></p>

<p>All that is dainty, striking and musical in verse and
healthy in sentiment, the YELLOW BOOK aims to publish.
Most folks hate "po'try," but the YELLOW BOOK gives them
the kind that even ardent verse-haters cannot resist.</p>


<p class="sidenote"><b>FICTION</b></p>

<p>The YELLOW BOOK contains FIVE short stories in each
issue. They are all clean, clever and new. Thus the
YELLOW BOOK has as much fiction as any of the five-cent monthlies;
but then remember that fiction is only a fourth part of the magazine.
Therefore in the YELLOW BOOK you get four times as much for five
cents as you do in any of the others. You could not strike it richer
except in Klondike.</p>


<p><i>The YELLOW BOOK is for sale by all newsdealers and booksellers
or will be sent direct to any address, on receipt of price, by the
publishers.</i></p>
